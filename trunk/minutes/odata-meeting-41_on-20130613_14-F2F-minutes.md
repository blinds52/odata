Discussion:

* All discuss using */$ref i.c.w. explicitly specifying navigation properties resulting in the explicitly referenced navigations properties to be expanded inline whereas all others will be returned by reference
* Hubert: $expand=foo,bar,*/$ref
* Hubert: Implying that foo and bar are completely expanded in place and all other navigation properties are returned by reference only

* All note, that also the term "Metadata URL" might change into "Context URL" (cf. [ODATA-447](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-447))

: "Specify canonical form of entity-id" [components: OData URL Conventions, OData Protocol] is **New**.

Discussion:

* All discuss on whether we should allow multiple cast segments in a row.

Discussion(cont. on day two):

* Ralf summarizes the state of discussion
* All state, that some annotations must be inline, because the thing they annotate cannot be identified. thus they must be represented by a complex type. Annotations that can be external are represented as external, even if they are represented inline for convenience. these two types of annotations (inlined and external) reflect the reality of the two so we are okay with the distinction.

Ralf:

Context:
>We prepare towards approving CSD02 in next Meeting on 2013-06-20 by Call during 0800-1000 PT

### 7.1 Remaining issues

####7.1.1 [ODATA-386](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-386)


ODATA-386:
: "odata-v4.0-csprd01-part1-protocol, 3 Data Model, appears to be an unnumbered list of definitions, with annotations defined in a separate subsection - suggest new format, etc." [component: OData Protocol] is **Open**.

Discussion:

* Mike will work with Patrick offline to craft wording to address his comments for ODATA-386, to be reviewed by the TC at the Thursday meeting.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**.

####7.1.2 [ODATA-448](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-448)


ODATA-448:
: "Add Nullable facet to edm:ReturnType" [component: OData CSDL] is **New**.

Ralf: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-448 as proposed. **Hubert seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-448:
: "Add Nullable facet to edm:ReturnType" [component: OData CSDL] is **Resolved** with no objections.

####7.1.3 [ODATA-449](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-449)


ODATA-449:
: "Remove IsBindable attribute from edm:Function" [components: OData ATOM Format, OData ABNF Construction Rules, OData JSON Format, OData CSDL, OData URL Conventions, OData Protocol] is **New**.

Discussion:

* Ralf summarizes the discussion on action/function overloads as follows: "The goal for action and function overload resolution is that the overload can be identified by inspecting the URL only. This goal leads to restrictions on which overloads can be defined. Actions are easy as a) non-bindable actions cannot have overloads because the URL just contains the action name, all parameters are in the POST body and b) bindable actions can have overloads based on the binding parameter type because the binding parameter is specified in the URL. Functions are tricky"
* Shishir suggests to limit the flexibility we are trying to provide with isBindable vor this version
* All agree to revisit the issue later the day.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**.

ODATA-449:
: "Remove IsBindable attribute from edm:Function" [components: OData ATOM Format, OData ABNF Construction Rules, OData JSON Format, OData CSDL, OData URL Conventions, OData Protocol] is **Open** with no objections.

Processing continued during day two:

Discussion (cont.):

* Barbara states that the proposal has been updated with the result of the discussion
* Mike summarizes the discussion about the ability to pass a reference to an existing entity by url; i.e., 
        ~foo(KEY(Customers('ALFKI'))
* Mike recaps, that all said this was really a reference, not a key, and proposed renaming to REF.
* Matt asks what the casing should be.
* Mike suggests, that this is the same as the urlref we have named for annotation expressions.
* Stefan asks for confirmation, that this is related to yesterdays edm:UrlRef
* Mike continues to conclude, that we thus should name it as urlref and, for version 4.0, only allow it to take the canonical url for an entity. We can relax this in the future to be any url.
* Ralf states the example: 
        ProductsByCustomerReferences(customers=@c)?@c=[urlref(Customers(1)),urlref(Customers(3))]
* Ralf sees the example given as a JSON-inspired way of passing arrays of references

Stefan: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-449 as proposed. **Ralf seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

Context:
> We received the public Comment #20130600012 on 2013-06-14 with title "feedback/discussion now that public comment period is over". To prepare processing a corresponding JIRA issue [ODATA-451](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-451) has been created with summary "Provide section that clearly indicates what system query options are allowed on the various combinations of URL type and HTTP method (public comment c201306e00012)" [component: Unknown].

Original mail text was:
> "`Where can I send comments about or have discussion regarding the OData v4 spec now that the public comment period is over?
I would like to know if the $select and $expand system query options are allowed on insert entity requests to limit or expand the data that is returned (when it is requested via a PREFER header that data be returned).  A section that clearly indicates what system query options are allowed on the various combinations of URL type and HTTP method would be helpful (unless it exists already and I just missed it).`"

AI#0019
: "Prepare Working Draft 01 (WD01) version of OData Extension for XML Data" [owner: Stefan Drees] is **Ongoing** (Note: Due 2013-06-14)

Discussion:

* Stefan has started to plan how to support Susan in translating the xml extension concept as vocabulary
* Susan suggests to defer JSON to end of July along with XML. She has set up a call with Stefan on Monday to review structure of XML extension. When this is defined, JSON will follow the same structure
* Both actions are ongoing
* As new due date for the delivery of a first working draft of this vocabulary (and the one relevant for JSON) end of July is suggested 
* All agree
