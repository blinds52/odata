<h3>6. Version 4.0 Errata 3 Issues</h3>

<h4>6.1 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-882" target="_blank">ODATA-882</a> - Mismatch between 11.2.6 Requesting Related Entities and 11.2.7 Requesting Entity References</h4>

<p>Ram: ODATA-882 is OPEN</p>

<p>Ram: In errata 3 - be lenient and allow for both to accommodate current implementations. This issue should be fixed in v4.1 (potential breaking change) - we need to determine the exact semantics.</p>
<p>Mike:</p> 
<p>Unclear whether behavior should be 204 or 404.  We return 204 for Employees('TheBigBoss')/Manager because the question is valid and the answer is that there is no related resource (all agree).
</p>

<p>Argument for 404: When asking for Employees('TheBigBoss')/Manager/$ref, you are asking for the (absolute) reference to something that doesn't exist. This is similar to asking for the address of an object (i.e., the address of an object-valued property of an instance) that doesn't exist and should be an error (404).
</p>

<p>Argument for 204: It's the same question, asked in a different way. In both cases you're asking for the resource. In one case you're asking for the resource, in another case you're asking for an alternate representation (the $ref) of the resource.
</p>

<p>Ram: We need to specify a one or the other behavior, so as to set the expectations for the client.</p>


<h4>6.2 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-784" target="_blank">ODATA-784</a> - Need to specify the behaviour of arithmetic operators on Decimal type</h4>

<p>Ram: ODATA-784: Need to specify the behaviour of arithmetic operators on Decimal type [Open] [Proposed]</p>

<p>Mike: So all of the implementations follow Evan's proposed rules for add/sub/mult. None of the implementations appear to follow Evan's rule for div.</p>
<p>Susan: IEEE 754-2008 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011</p>

<p>Ram: For v4.1, should we require scale up for div?</p>
<p>Mike: Most of the Div examples seems to return the value in the max scale of the underlying type.</p>
<p>Mike: It appears that Evan's proposal for div (of Scale(A)) does not agree with his later comments (Scale(A)+Scale(B)).</p>
<p>Mike: Added to Issue:</p>
<p>Mike: All of the implementations follow Evan's proposed rules for add/sub/mult. None of the implementations appear to follow Evan's rule for div.</p>

<p>Mike:</p>
<p>
Most of the Div examples seems to return the value in the max scale of the underlying type.  <br>
=>How would a client know this value?<br>
=>If an implementation is aggregating data from multiple underlying sources, how could it return (or even correct for) a single value for max scale? Would it be forced to convert everything to the min max scale?<br>
<br>
There seem to be at least 5 proposals for div:<br><br>
Scale(A)<br>
Scale(A)+Scale(B)<br>
Scale(A)-Scale(B)<br>
>= Scale(A)  (doesn't seem to address Evan's second case  (A div 3) gt 0.3)<br>
max precision of decimal<br>
</p>
<p>Susan: Will look to see what IEEE 754-2008 (ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011) specifies. (<em>Update after the meeting: Info has been added to the issue</em>)</p>

<h3>7. Next meeting</h3>

<h4>7.1 Thursday January 14, 2016 during 8-10am PT?</h4>
<p>Date and time of next meeting agreed</p>
<p>Ram: Next week: Focus on issues on Enums, simplified syntax, payload processing, and other issues that may have proposals.</p>
<p>Ram: Next week: We will discuss status of the various docs and timeline, and what we plan to accomplish by June 2016</p>

<h3>8. AOB and wrap up</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<p>Meeting adjourned by chair.</p>
