1.  Introduction

   Meta object only!

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The ordering of the members of any JSON object defined in this
   document MUST be considered irrelevant, as specified by [RFC4627].

   The ordering of the elements of any JSON array defined in this
   document MUST at least follow a stable ordering unless the specific
   object's type it is a member of defines an absolute ordering, which
   then takes precedence.

   Some examples use the combination of a JavaScript single line comment
   (//) followed by an ellipsis (...) as placeholder notation for
   content deemed irrelevant by the authors and at that point.  These
   placeholders must of course be deleted or otherwise replaced, before
   attempting to validate the corresponding JSON code example.

1.2.  Example

   A JSON OData object:

   {
       "d": {
       // ...
       }
   }


   Note that unquoted whitespace is not significant in JSON.  Whitespace
   is used in the examples inside this document to help illustrate the
   data structures, but is not required.
