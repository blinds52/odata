<h4>4.1 Action items due by March 26, 2015</h4>

<h5>4.1.1 Follow up with JSON-Schema on use for modeling</h5>

<p>Ralf: Meeting with JSON / JSON Schema experts at Microsoft. Talked through several of our issues
<br>Two approaches discussed:
<br>1: add OData/modeling semantics to JSON Schema, as a standard or an extension
<br>2: use OData/modeling-specific JSON format that can be transformed into JSON Schema
<br>
<br>Inheritance most problematic/controversial
<br>Swagger uses #2: specialized JSON format whose structure is described by JSON Schema
<br>Some suggestions on improving our draft JSON Schema representation of CSDL
<br>Nullability can in some cases be expressed more compact
<br>Enums problematic
<br>#2 is similar to what we do with XML
<br>Have specific format described by XSD
</p>
<p>Ralf to send examples of "our" JSON Schema to Susan for validation tests</p>


<h3>5. Process issues (for V4.0_ERRATA03 in New or Open state)</h3>

<h4>5.1 OData Protocol</h4>

<h5>5.1.1 ODATA-479 "Allow Content-ID referencing in request bodies for inserting links to newly created entities"</h5>

<p>Ralf: Services allowing $&lt;content-id value&gt; syntax in request bodies for inserting links SHOULD advertise this with the new term BatchContentIdReferencingInRequestBodiesSupported in the Capabilities vocabulary: </p>

<pre>
    &lt;Term Name="BatchContentIdReferencingInRequestBodiesSupported" Type="Core.Tag" DefaultValue="true" AppliesTo="EntityContainer"&gt; 
         &lt;Annotation Term="Core.Description" String="Service supports Content-ID referencing in request bodies" /&gt;
    &lt;/Term&gt;
</pre>

<p>Ralf: Term name is rather long</p>

<p>Mike: I move we resolve ODATA-479 as proposed, including giving clear guidance to V4 clients that this is a new pattern and that they should check capabilities before assuming service support. Martin seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-479 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h5>5.1.2 ODATA-790 "Bug in example 70"</h5>

<p>Ralf: change example 70 to: </p>
<pre>
 &lt;Function Name="MostRecentOrder" IsBound="true"&gt; 
   &lt;Parameter Name="customer" Type="SampleModel.Customer" /&gt;
   &lt;ReturnType="SampleModel.Order" /&gt; 
 &lt;/Function&gt;
</pre>
<p>Ralf: Current text uses attribute notation for ReturnType, which is no longer supported</p>

<p>ODATA-790 is OPEN</p>

<p>Martin: I move to resolve ODATA-790 as proposed. Mike seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-790 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h5>5.1.3 ODATA-791 "11.2.5.2 System Query Option $orderby: specify order of Edm.Boolean and Edm.Geo"</h5>

<p>Ralf: Edm.Boolean: null &lt; false &lt; true <br>
<br>
<br>Edm.Geo*, Edm.Stream: no sorting possible
</p>
 
<p>Ramesh: In SQL it is explicit <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.6.2.1/ref/rrefsqlj13658.html" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.6.2.1/ref/rrefsqlj13658.html</a></p>

<p>All: check with programming languages whether any of them have a problem with false &lt; true, add comment to Jira issue for those languages</p>

<p>ODATA-791: Deferred to next meeting</p>


<h5>5.1.4 ODATA-794 "14.4.2.2: Create Related Entities When Creating an Entity"</h5>

<p>Ralf: Do not partially restate the 201/204 rule from section 11.4.2 and shorten paragraph 3 to: <br>
<br>
<br> On success, the service MUST create all entities and relate them. If the service responds with 201 Created, the response MUST be expanded to at least the level that was present in the deep-insert request.
</p>

<p>ODATA-794 is OPEN</p>

<p>Ralf: On success, the service MUST create all entities and relate them. If the request included a return Prefer header with a value of return=representation and is applied by the service, the response MUST be expanded to at least the level that was present in the deep-insert request.</p>

<p>Mike: I move we resolve ODATA-794 as proposed. Mark seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-794 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h5>5.1.5 ODATA-800 "Media streams section does not reference the AtomPub spec"</h5>

<p>Ralf: ODATA-800 is OPEN</p>
<p>All: if you have use cases for the slug header, please add them to the Jira issue</p>
<p>Deferred until Jira issue contains a proposal</p>

<h4>5.2 OData Vocabularies</h4>

<h5>5.2.1 ODATA-779 "Org.OData.Core.V1 defines Term IsURL but references it as IsUrl"</h5>

<p>Ralf: ODATA-779 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: Fix the reference to refer to "Core.IsURL".</p>
<p>Martin: I propose to resolve ODATA-779 as proposed. Mark seconds.</p>

<p>Mike: With direction to the editors to ensure it is correct cased in all uses.</p>
<p>ODATA-779 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h5>5.2.2 ODATA-797 "Org.OData.Capabilities.V1 term property FilterRestrictions/RequiresFilter has wrong facets"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-797 is OPEN</p>

<p>Martin: I move to resolve ODATA-797 as proposed. Gerald seconds</p>
<p>ODATA-797 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h4>5.3 OData CSDL</h4>

<h5>5.3.1 ODATA-789 "Primitive type Edm.Decimal is ill-defined in regard to Precision"</h5>
<p>Ralf: Proposal:<br>
<br>
<br>Clarify that CSDL Precision for Edm.Decimal is the number of significant decimal digits. 
<br>
<br>Allow Precision=Scale and don't count the "0." into the Precision in this special case. 
<br>
<br>Allow exponential notation, combined with an annotation that expresses the range of the exponent (MinExponent,MaxExponent). 
<br>
<br>Allow negative Scale and Scale larger than Precision (this requires exponential notation). 
<br>
<br>Require that any client or server which can represent a value of type Edm.Decimal must preserve all significant digits.
</p>

<p>Mike: I think the first proposal is simply a clarification, and the second is correcting an issue we accidentally introduced in Errata 2 where we were confused between value range and lexical representation.</p>

<p>Mike: The exponential notation with a minexponent and negative scale concern me as they are changing the interpretation of decimal.</p>

<p>Mike: Ralf suggests narrowing ODATA-789 to fixing the first two issues, and addressing exponential notation issue ODATA-771 and open a new issue for negative scale.</p>

<p>Mike: I move we narrow ODATA-789 to fixing the first two issues, address exponential notation issue ODATA-771 and open a new issue for negative scale. Martin seconds.</p>
<p>Motion passes</p>

<p>Mike: I move we resolve ODATA-789 as amended by addressing the first two issues, handling exponential notation in ODATA-771, and opening a new issue for negative scale. Martin seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-789 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h3>6. JSON representation for metadata</h3>
<h4>Walk through the document and decide on the general principles</h4>


<h3>7. Next meeting</h3>

<p>Thursday April 16, 2015 during 8-10am PDT / 17:00-19:00 CEST ?</p>
<p>Agreed</p>


<h3>8. AOB and wrap up</h3>

<p>Stefan: GeoJSON is in IETF dispatch for work group</p>
<p>Ralf: Stefan will provide more information in the next meeting</p>

<p>Ramesh: reached out to developers of TripPin service at Microsoft. MIT licences of TripPin is OK for Apache, so Olingo project could build an example implementation
</p>
<p>Ramesh: already implemented it. Discussion on incorporating this into Olingo project is ongoing</p>
<p>Ralf to contact Ram on what has to be done to use TripPin as basis for examples in OData specification</p>


<h3>Meeting adjourned</h3>
