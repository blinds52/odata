<h4>4.1 Action items due by April 16, 2015</h4>

<h5>4.1.1 Follow up with JSON-Schema on use for modeling</h5>

<p>No news./p>


<h3>5. Process issues (for V4.0_ERRATA03 in New or Open state)</h3>

<h4>5.1 OData CSDL</h4>

<h5>5.1.1 ODATA-801 "Consider supporting negative scale for decimal type"</h5>

<p>ODATA-801 is OPEN</p>
<p>Mike: how does Oracle treat these data types in APIs (ODBC, ADO.net)</p>
<p>Mark: Will look into this</p>
<p>Defer to future meeting</p>
<p>Discuss together with other issues on Edm.Decimal: ODATA-771, ODATA-804</p>

<h5>5.1.2 ODATA-803 "Collection-valued property: Define default value for nullable facet"</h5>
<p>Mike: if Nullable facet is missing clients SHOULD expect that the collection may contain null values. 
<br>What do current implementations do?</p>
<p>Ramesh: To look into Olingo implementation</p>
<p>Mike: resolve as proposed and add note that absence of Nullable facet doesn't guarantee that service will accept null values</p>
<pre>{ "value":[1,null,3] }</pre>
<p>ODATA-803 is OPEN</p>
<p>Martin: The edm http://webconf.soaphub.org/conf/images/tongue.gifroperty element MAY contain the Nullable attribute whose Boolean value specifies whether a value is required for the property.</p>
 

<p>Mike: I move we approve ODATA-803 as proposed, with a cautionary note to clients that, since this default was not defined in 4.0, in the absence of this facet clients should be prepared to receive collections containing null values but should be prepared for the service to refuse collections containing null values. Hubert seconds.</p>
 
<p>ODATA-803 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h4>5.2 OData JSON Format</h4>

<h5>5.2.1 ODATA-771 "Exponential notation for Edm.Decimal values in JSON payloads"</h5>

<p>Hubert proposes F2F in Hawaii between August 04 and August 17</p>
<p>Defer issue to future meeting</p>

<h4>5.3 OData Protocol</h4>

<h5>5.3.1 ODATA-791 "11.2.5.2 System Query Option $orderby: specify order of Edm.Boolean and Edm.Geo"</h5>
 

<p>Pizzo: I move we resolve ODATA-791 as proposed. Martin seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-791 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h4>5.4 OData Vocabularies</h4>

<h5>5.4.1 ODATA-802 "Define a vocabulary for odata.* annotations"</h5>

<p>Mike: odata.* is special for JSON, the same meta information would not be represented as annotations in Atom. 
<br>If we make it a vocabulary, even in the context of the JSON Format specification, it may get used in $metadata</p>
<p>ODATA-802 is OPEN</p>
<p>Matt: it seems odd that information is represented in JSON as annotations and differently in other formats</p>
 

<p>Matt: I move to close ODATA-802 without action. Mike seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-802 is closed without action</p>

<h3>6. Next meeting</h3>

<p>Thursday April 30, 2015 during 8-10am PDT / 17:00-19:00 CEST ?</p>
<p>Agreed</p>


<h3>7. AOB and wrap up</h3>

<p>Ramesh: I have a question: How should a EDM.Stream value be handled in ComplexType? I did not see any reference to that in specification?
</p>
<p>Answer/discussion not minuted</p>

<h3>Meeting adjourned</h3>
