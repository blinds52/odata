<p>ODATA-869 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h5>6.1.4 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-870" target="_blank">ODATA-870</a> - Round-off description for creating related entities when creating an entity</h5>

<p>Ralf: Don't describe any rules in 11.4.2.2, but merely refer to 11.4.2, like this: <br>
"A request to create an entity that includes related entities, represented using the appropriate inline representation, is referred to as a deep insert. Media entities, whose binary representation cannot be represented inline, cannot be created within a deep insert. <br>
<br> 
The entity is created observing the rules described in section 11.4.2 as if it was posted against the original target URL extended with the navigation property for this related entity. <br>
<br> 
On success, the service  <br>
"<br></p>

<p>Ralf: ODATA-870 is OPEN</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-870 as proposed. <b>Hubert</b> seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-870 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h5>6.1.5 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-882" target="_blank">ODATA-882</a> - Mismatch between 11.2.6 Requesting Related Entities and 11.2.7 Requesting Entity References</h5>

<p>Ralf: 11.2.6 defines that requests to nullable single-valued navigation properties return 204 No Content if no entity is currently related.<br>
11.2.7 defines that all requests for references to a single entity return 404 Not Found, not distinguishing between "direct" resource paths and resource paths to related entities. <br>
<br>
This leads to:</p> 
<pre>
GET Employees('TheBigBoss')/Manager --&gt; 204 No Content 
GET Employees('TheBigBoss')/Manager/$ref --&gt; 404 Not Found 
</pre>
<p>
Clarify whether this is intentional: <br>
A) Of course, the related Manager is empty, so the reference does not exist, or <br>
B) Ooops, of course both requests should return the same response code because /$ref is just a briefer representation of the non-existing related entity <br>
<br> 
Also clarify what happens if other path segments are added, e.g. properties or navigation properties: <br></p> 
<pre>
GET Employees('TheBigBoss')/Manager/Name --&gt; ??? <br>
GET Employees('TheBigBoss')/Manager/Department --&gt; ???<br>
</pre>

<p>Ralf: ODATA-882 is OPEN</p>

<p>Ralf: If the property is single-valued and has the null value, the service responds with 204 No Content.<br>
If the property is not available, for example due to permissions, the service responds with 404 Not Found.<br>
Ralf Handl (SAP): A $value request for a property that is null results in a 204 No Content response.<br>
If the property is not available, for example due to permissions, the service responds with 404 Not Found.<br></p>

<p>Mike: look at other implementations and find out what they do</p>
