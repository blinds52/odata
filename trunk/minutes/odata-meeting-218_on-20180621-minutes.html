<p>Gerald: </p>
<pre>
GET ~/Sales?$apply=topcount(2,Amount)
$apply=groupby((Product),topcount(1,Date))

The topcount transformation takes two parameters.

The first parameter specifies the number of instances to return in the transformed set. 
It MUST be an expression that can be evaluated on the set level and MUST result in a positive integer.

The second parameter specifies the value by which the instances are compared for determining the result set. 
It MUST be an expression that can be evaluated on instances of the input set and MUST result in a primitive numeric value.

The transformation retains the number of instances specified by the first parameter that have the highest values specified by the second expression.

In case the value of the second expression is ambiguous, the service MUST impose a stable ordering before 
determining the returned instances.
</pre>
<p>Gerald: Proposal: Replace current definitions by "[...] and MUST result in values of a primitive type whose values are totally ordered.".</p>

<p>Gerald: </p>
<pre>
The keyword with is used to apply an aggregation method to an aggregatable property or expression.
Instead of applying a single aggregation method for calculating the aggregated value of an expression across all properties no

Proposal: At the beginning of section 3 for $apply, define that any reference to an expression, 
if not specified otherwise, refers to "those expressions that could also be used in a $filter 
system query option and result in a value of primitive type". With such a statement in the preamble, 
this phrase could then be deleted from some some sub-sections.

This specification defines the following terms:

- Aggregatable Property  a property for which the values can be aggregated using an aggregation method.
- Aggregation Method  a method that can be used to aggregate an aggregatable property or expression
- Standard Aggregation Method  one of the standard aggregation methods: sum, min, max, average, and countdistinct
- Custom Aggregation Method  a custom aggregation method that can be applied to expressions of a specified type
- Custom Aggregate  a dynamic property that can appear in an aggregate clause
- Groupable Property  a property whose values can be used to group entities or complex type instances for aggregation.
- Hierarchy  an arrangement of groupable properties whose values are represented as being above, below, or at the same level as one another.
</pre>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-1040 is OPEN</p>
<p>Gerald: revise proposal to define "Expression" in section 2.1</p>
<p>Gerald: New proposal: In section 2.1, add a definition of expressions: is a common expression resulting in a value of primitive type</p>
<p>George: if needed define "general expression" and "primitive expression" and use appropriately</p>
<p>Gerald: </p>
<pre>
In section 2.1, add a definition of expressions: is a common expression; 
and of primitive expression being an expression resulting in a value of primitive type

Check all occurrencies in the text for occurrences of "expression" and update accordingly.

<p>Ralf: </p>
<pre>
Description

It is interesting to get the ratio between an individual and an aggregated value from the same input set. 

Examples:

1. Customer classification: Revenue per customer in relation to total revenue
2. Revenue trend: Revenue per year in relation to total revenue for any given customer
3. Order size: Order volume relative to average order volume

They cannot be expressed with combining groupby/aggregate, because the individual 
entity values are no longer available after these transformations have produced an aggregated value.

The ratio transformation takes a comma-separated list of one or more parameters 
describing a value, an aggregate expression, and an alias:

ratio(valueExpression to aggregateExpression as alias, )

A valueExpression may be an expression valid in a $filter system query option on the 
input set that results in a simple value. The aggregateExpression is an aggregate expression 
as defined for transformation aggregate (section 3.1). The alias introduces a dynamic property 
for the ratio values in the result set that are of type Edm.Decimal with unspecified precision 
and variable scale.

The transformation first determines the aggregated value for the input set by applying 
the aggregateExpression. Then, it calculates for every entity in the input set the ratio 
between the valueExpression and the aggregated value and adds the result as dynamic property 
to the entity that is put into the result set.

Applied to examples:

Re 1:

GET ~/Sales?$apply=
groupby((Customer),aggregate(Amount with sum as CustomerAmount)) 
/ratio(CustomerAmount to CustomerAmount with sum as RevenueContribution)

Re 2:

GET ~/Sales?$apply=
groupby((Customer,Year) aggregate(Amount with sum as CustomerYearAmount))
/groupby((Customer),ratio(CustomerYearAmount to CustomerYearAmount with sum as RevenueTrend)

Re 3:

GET ~/Sales?$apply=ratio(Amount to Amount with average as RelativeOrderSize)

In all these example, the value expression is identical with the base in the aggregate expression, 
that is, they follow the pattern: ratio(X to X with M as A). If there were no other use cases, 
the syntax could be simplified to: ratio(X with M as A).
</pre>
<p>Gerald:</p>
<pre>
GET ~/Sales?$apply=
groupby((Customer),aggregate(Amount with sum as CustomerAmount))
/ratio(CustomerAmount to CustomerAmount with sum as RevenueContribution)
ratio(valueExpression to aggregateExpression as alias, )
Order size: Order volume relative to average order volume
GET ~/Sales?$apply=ratio(Amount to Amount with average as RelativeOrderSize)
</pre>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-947 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: </p>
<pre>
ratio combines aggregate and compute in a special way
Maybe there's a more generic way to express that
</pre>
<p>Hubert: </p>
<pre>
think about similar use cases
ratio() is very useful
combine this with hierarchies
revenue contribution of offices to countries to continents
ability to refer to the input set
</pre>
<p>Ralf: Defer until we have more use cases and a clearer understanding</p>
