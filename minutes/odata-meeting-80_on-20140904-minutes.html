<h5>6.2.1 Discussion</h5>

<ul>
<li>Stefan recommends the draft document</li>
<li>Martin asks about cost to get access to OData status</li>
<li>Ed REST APIs possible competitors to OData</li>
<li>Mark: Oasis Standard should still be downloaded with no fee even if ISO charges a fee</li>
<li>Hubert states, that OData provides a superset of protocol capabilities</li>
<li>ED assumes the possibility of a possible bloat view of OData</li>
<li>Ram and ED suggest to evangilize protocol included in open source community</li>
<li>All suggest, to remind folks of discussion about <b>using ODBC</b>: Argument of high standard conformance benefits versus low tech efficiency</li>
<li>All also remind, that OData allows for different levels of compliance.  For instance level mininal allows for low effort compliance as a head start in reaching higher levels of conformance where everyone will benefit from (interoperability etc.)</li>
<li>Mike and Hubert further emphasize interoperability; OData encapsulates best practises of software engineering</li>
<li>Ed consider Node.js /server as possibly breaking OData expectations</li>
<li>Hubert mentions server side library and client library as scope already accomplished/covered by OData</li>
<li>All agree on a deeper discussion for a future agenda.</li>
<li>Ted suggests to consider comparison articles on protocols and exploring REST APIs (virt.x)</li>
<li>Ram asks all to look at Node.js and virt.x</li>
<li>Ed adds to also look at backbone.sync (popular javascript framework with a CRUD rest method.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.3  Approval to start a Special Majority Ballot to approve submitting OData v4 and OData JSON Format v4 for international standardization</h4>
