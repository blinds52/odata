###5.3 Issues in Open and Proposed State###


####5.3.1 [ODATA-65](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-65)####

Context:
>(pick up pending motion to resolve deferred from 2012-SEP-06 meeting)

ODATA-65
: "Remove the edm:Mode attribute" [component: OData CSDL]. 

Further discussion on the motion on the table:

* Mike suggests to move again to open state.
* Stefan reminds of the fact, that ODATA-57 states: 'The informative XSD shouldn't mislead readers, and (being just informative) needn't be built for forwards-compatibility, so we should remove the "extension points".' and also in a comment by Ralf: 'Will wait for ODATA-85 to be applied.'
* Mike clarifies, he has nothing against resolving ODATA-65, but that in the extensibility section of OData Protocol version 1.0, we specify that clients MUST ignore content that they do not understand. This is for future compatibility, and would allow us to add edm:Mode at a later time.
* Mike adds that however, in ODATA-57 we removed the ability to add content to the xsd, meaning that a client validating with that XSD would fail if we added new elements/attributes in the future (such as Edm:Mode).
* Mike thus concludes to propose we amend the motion to accept ODATA-65, but to reopen ODATA-57.
* Ralf seconds.

Mike: 
>I **move** to amend the motion on the table to accept ODATA-65 and to reopen ODATA-57. **Ralf seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **amendment passes**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **amended motion passes**.

: "Remove the edm:Mode attribute" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as proposed** with no objections.

: "Remove xs:any and xs:anyAttribute from Informative XSD" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as open** with no objections.


###5.4 Issues in New and Proposed state (bunch 1) that may potentially be resolved as a bunch###

####5.4.1 [ODATA-81](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-81)####

ODATA-81
: "Rewrite section 3 Service Root URL for clarity and readability" [component: OData URL Conventions]. 


Mike: 
>I **move** to accept the resolution of ODATA-81 as proposed. **Stefan seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.


ODATA-81
: "Rewrite section 3 Service Root URL for clarity and readability" [component: OData URL Conventions] is **approved as proposed** with no objections. 

####5.4.2[ODATA-82](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-82)####

ODATA-82
: "Rewording of 4 Resource Path first paragraph" [component: OData URL Conventions].


Stefan: 
>I **move** to accept the resolution of ODATA-82 as proposed. **Hubert seconds**.

Mike:
>I **move** to change MAY to SHOULD in 'The rules for resource path construction as defined in this section are optional. OData services MAY follow some or all of the subsequently described URL path construction rules and are indeed encouraged to do so, as such a service cross consistency promotes a rich ecosystem of reusable client components and libraries.' (in order to encourage ecosystem). **Ralf seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **amendment passes**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **amended motion passes**.


ODATA-82
: "Rewording of 4 Resource Path first paragraph" [component: OData URL Conventions] is **approved as proposed with the change in wording from the amended motion** with no objections. 

####5.4.3[ODATA-83](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-83)####

ODATA-83
: "Rewording of 4 Resource Path second paragraph for clarity and readability" [component: OData URL Conventions].

Discussion:

* Mike suggests to accept ODATA-83 as amended in his comment #1 on the issue, i.e.:

`Propose slight rewording:`

`- "Orders related to Customers in London" should be "Orders related to a single Customer", as the later better represents the types of URLs supported by an OData service.`

`-"service operations" should be "operations", as the former specific type of operations have been deprecated in favor of the general class of operations, including functions and actions.`

`Reworded:`

`Any aspect of any resource exposed by an OData service MUST be addressable by a corresponding resource path URL component to enable interaction of the client with that resource aspect.`

`To illustrate the context, some examples for resources might be: Customers, a single Customer, Orders related to a single Customer, and so forth. Examples of addressable aspects of these resources as exposed by the data model might be: collections of entities, a single entity, properties, Links, operations, and so on.`

Mike: 
>I **move** we adopt ODATA-83 as proposed in comment #1. **Stefan seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-83
: "Rewording of 4 Resource Path second paragraph for clarity and readability" [component: OData URL Conventions] is **approved as proposed** with no objections.

##6. Next face to face meeting##

>Context: The completed [e-ballot](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/ballot.php?id=2278) on possible date ranges for the next F2F

###6.1 Host for the upcoming face to face meeting### 

>Assumed requirements:    

* a room for at most 20 members (since not all voting members will be able to participate locally)
* including a telephone line for hooking the conference system
* and of course an internet connection (for the chat).

Any volunteers?

Discussion:

* Hubert states, that IBM will probably host. The final committment shall be available start of next week. Details with regard to venue and dates see below in items 6.2 and 6.3

###6.2 Venue of the upcoming face to face meeting###
    
Discussion:

* Hubert waits on confirmation for reserved rooms but already informs about venue address: IBM Littleton Labs,  550 King Street Littleton, Boston, MA, USA.

###6.3 Dates of the upcoming face to face meeting### 

Discussion:

* Hubert waits on confirmation for reserved rooms but already informs about dates: 2012-NOV-08 and 2012-NOV-09. Reason for not being able to offer three day slot for full membership is sparseness of available large enough rooms in that area and week. 
* Hubert adds: A day before only smaller rooms available (erverything else seems to be booked out).

 
 
##7 Timeline and next steps##

###7.1 Review of the projected Timeline [[TL_REF][TL_REF]]###

Discussion:

* Mike is impressed by the number of issues we were able to work through, but that there are still some medium sized issues that need work and timeline looks aggresive but doable
* Mike also asks how the 2013-JAN-17 date ligns up with what?
* Barabara details that the second next f2f might be in february so planning backwards in time this January date looked promising
* Mike asks how these spec staging increments might align with the second next face to face
* Ram explains that the 2013-JAN-17 date was motivated by info on needed time intervals of tc admins to push our stuff


##8 Next meeting##

###8.1 Proposed Thursday Sep 20, 2012 0800-0900 PT###

Agreed. 


##9 AOB##

None. 

Ram suggests the tc members always check by Monday or Tuesday each week about possible issue groupings, optimal processing sequence orderings etc to optimize issue processing during the meeting each Thursday.

### Meeting adjourned on 0900 PT.###


# Appendices#
## Timeline Reference [TL_REF] ##
 
Based on the number of issues (120) and the time (roughly one month) it has taken to resolve about 30 issues, it seems that it would take at least another 3-4 months to process all remaining issues, including other issues that may be filed in due course. Here is a rough draft of a timeline for producing the Committee Specification Draft 01 (CSD01) version of the OData core specifications:

* 2012-OCT-20 (about 2 weeks before the next F2F in November)
	* TC completes end-to-end review of the specs and files away any remaining issues
* 2012-NOV-09 (F2F meeting sometime during the week of Nov 5-9, details TBD)
	*  Discuss proposals and resolve issues
* 2013-JAN-17
	* Committee Specification Draft 01 (reflecting disposition of all the issues)
 
The timeline for OData extension specifications is TBD.
