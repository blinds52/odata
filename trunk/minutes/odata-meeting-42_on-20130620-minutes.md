* Hubert: ~Customers('ALFKI')/ns.bar(entities=@e)?@e=[Orders(1),Orders(2)]
* Matt: Can you use this in a $filter?  For example, ~/Product?$filter=$root/Customers('ALFKI')\Name eq 'Matt'.
* Ralf: yes
* All: Hubert will open a ticket for his example for the next release
* Ralf: SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = (SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ID = 'ALFKI')

####5.1.38 [ODATA-454](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-454)

ODATA-454:
: "Need a way to specify a property is unavailable" [components: OData JSON Format, OData ATOM Format, Vocabularies] is **New**.

Discussion:

* All: Mike updates the proposal
* Mike: revised proposal: 1) Define a core term that can be used as a data/metadata annotation:

        <Term Name="Permissions" Type="Core.Permission" AppliesTo="Edm.Property"/>
        <EnumType Name="Permission" Flags="true">
          <Member Name="None" Value="0" />
          <Member Name="Read" Value="1" />
          <Member Name="Write" Value="2" />
          <Member Name="ReadWrite" Value="3" />
        </EnumType>

* Mike: revised proposal(cont.): 1a) For 4.0, we will omit the Write member.

* Mike: revised proposal(cont.): 2) Allow the service to omit properties from the payload that are specified in metadata, even if they are selected. Such omitted properties have no value (as distinct from null) and should be annotated with the Core.Permissions term. Instances with omitted values for properties that appear in the $filter expression are excluded from the result. Accessing an omitted value returns 404.

* Mike: revised proposal(cont.): 3) In the payload, properties that the client does not have permission to read are omitted from the payload (no dataroperty-name element in ATOM and no name/value pair in JSON) and annotated with the "None" permission.

* All agree.

### 5.2 Issues in Proposed state

####5.2.1 [ODATA-456](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-456)

ODATA-456:

Hubert: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-456 as proposed. **Martin seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-456:
: "Don't require client to specify odata.trackchanges preference on each page" [component: OData Protocol] is **Resolved** with no objections.

####5.2.2 [ODATA-457](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-457)

ODATA-457:
: "Require hash (#) on odata.type" [components: OData ATOM Format, OData ABNF Construction Rules, OData Extension for JSON Data] is **Open**.

Ralf: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-457 as proposed. **Mike seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-457:
: "Require hash (#) on odata.type" [components: OData ATOM Format, OData ABNF Construction Rules, OData Extension for JSON Data] is **Resolved** with no objections.

####5.2.3 [ODATA-458](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-458)

ODATA-458:
: "odata.isolation should be a header rather than an expectation" [component: OData Protocol] is **Open**.

Martin: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-458 as proposed. **Matt seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-458:
: "odata.isolation should be a header rather than an expectation" [component: OData Protocol] is **Resolved** with no objections.

####5.2.4 [ODATA-459](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-459)

ODATA-459:
: "State consequences of using IRIs that are not URLs" [components: OData Protocol, OData JSON Format] is **Open**.

Discussion:

* Mike: Direction to editors; in describing id, note that it supports any IRI; if the IRI is not a URL then you need to provide editlink and/or self link.
* Ralf: Updated proposal. State consequences of using IRIs that are not URLs.
* Ralf: Using an IRI that is not a URL as an entity-id requires to have in addition an edit link or read link. Even if the edit link is the standard encoded version of the IRI, they are treated as different and need to be represented separately in JSON

Ralf: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-459 as proposed. **Martin seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-459:
: "State consequences of using IRIs that are not URLs" [components: OData Protocol, OData JSON Format] is **Resolved** with no objections.

Discussion (cont.):

* Mike: I propose, for 4.0, we define that the client must be prepared to accept any IRI but that services must use URIs in 4.0 since we have no lossless representation of an IRI in the entity-id header.
* All agree.

Mike: 
>I **move** that for version 4.0, we define that the client must be prepared to accept any IRI but that services must use URIs in version 4.0 since we have no lossless representation of an IRI in the entity-id header. **John seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

: "State consequences of using IRIs that are not URLs" [components: OData Protocol, OData JSON Format] is **Resolved as noted in the motion** with no objections.

####5.2.5 [ODATA-460](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-460)

ODATA-460:
: "Add terms to capability vocabulary" [components: Vocabularies, OData Protocol] is **Open**.

Discussion:

* All: Martin updates the proposal.
* Martin: Updated as: 

        Add appropriate Terms to Capabilities Vocabulary for 
          SnapshotSupported, 
          BatchContinueonErrorSupported, 
          AsynchronousReqeustSupported 
        Modify term for callback to a complextype with a collection of additional protocols

* Mike suggests: The collection of protocols, if present, is the full set of protocols.
* Martin: Updated as:

        Add appropriate Terms to Capabilities Vocabulary for 
          SnapshotSupported,
          BatchContinueonErrorSupported,
          AsynchronousReqeustSupported
        Modify term for callback to a complextype with a collection of protocols. The collection of protocols, if present, is the full set of protocols.

Hubert: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-460 as proposed. **Martin seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-460:
: "Add terms to capability vocabulary" [components: Vocabularies, OData Protocol] is **Resolved** with no objections.

ODATA-441:
: "Specify canonical form of entity-id" [components: OData URL Conventions, OData Protocol] is **Resolved**.

Mike: 
>I **move** we accept the alternate proposal in ODATA-441; that the cast segment is added to the edit/read link by convention if the type of the instance is a derived type of the expected type. **Hubert seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-441:
: "Specify canonical form of entity-id" [components: OData URL Conventions, OData Protocol] is **Resolved as noted in the motion** with no objections.
