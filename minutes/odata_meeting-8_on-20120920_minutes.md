###8.1 Review of the projected Timeline [[TL_REF][TL_REF]]###

Discussion of Timeline:

* Ram hints at the new entry for the 3rd F2F

# Appendices#
## Timeline Reference [TL_REF] ##
 
Based on the number of issues (120) and the time (roughly one month) it has taken to resolve about 30 issues, it seems that it would take at least another 3-4 months to process all remaining issues, including other issues that may be filed in due course. Here is a rough draft of a timeline for producing the Committee Specification Draft 01 (CSD01) version of the OData core specifications:

* 2012-OCT-20 (about 2 weeks before the next F2F in November)
	* TC completes end-to-end review of the specs and files away any remaining issues
* 2012-NOV-09 (second F2F meeting sometime during the week of Nov 5-9, details TBD)
	*  Discuss proposals and resolve issues
* 2013-JAN-17
	* Committee Specification Draft 01 (reflecting disposition of all the issues)
* 2012-FEB-07 (during the week of Feb 5-7, tentative)
    * Third F2F meeting? (details TBD)
    * Discuss and resolve any remaining issues
    * Take steps towards public review
    * Make progress on extension specifications
 
The timeline for OData extension specifications is TBD.
