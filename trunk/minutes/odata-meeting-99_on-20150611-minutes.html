<h5>4.1.1 Follow up with JSON-Schema on use for modeling</h5>

<p>Mike: Sent the following to the JSON-Schema Google Group:
</p>
<pre>Dear JSON Schema Community;

We would like to understand from the experts whether or not JSON Schema is 
appropriate for our particular use case.

OData is an OASIS standard that defines an interoperable protocol for clients 
to interact with RESTful services in a completely generic manner. 

An important part of the protocol is the ability to describe the resources 
exposed by the service. OData uses an entity-relationship data model for 
describing these resources, and has defined an XML-based representation of 
this common data model (known as "CSDL").

OData uses a JSON representation for data payloads, and together with the 
growing popularity of JSON/Javascript clients, the OASIS OData Technical 
Committee (TC) has gotten numerous requests to provide a JSON representation 
of the data model as well as data payloads.

Given the significant overlap between describing a data model and validating 
the JSON payload returned from requests against the data model it is very 
tempting to use JSON Schema for both. In fact, we've seen other REST APIs, 
such as the DMTF "Redfish" specification, attempt to use JSON Schema to 
describe their resource model. However, in attempting to use JSON Schema 
to describe our data model we've run into a few issues that have caused 
us to question whether modeling is an appropriate use of JSON Schema.

So our question to the community is this:
Is JSON-Schema intended to be used for data modeling, or should we invest 
in an alternate "JSON Modeling" language that we would have first-class 
representation of concepts such as inheritance and relationships, and 
from which we could generate JSON Schema for validation?

We eagerly await your guidance in this area.

Thanks in advance,

Mike Pizzo
Editor, OASIS OData Technical Committee

<h5>4.1.2 Overview presentation on HTTP/2 features (Martin Zurmhl)</h5>
<p>Martin will present next meeting</p>

<h3>5. Discuss scope of TC work for the next 12-18 months</h3>

<h4>5.1 Mike will present summary of last meetings discussion</h4>

<p>E-Mail from Mike:</p>
<pre>
Following are my notes from our discussion in our May 21, 2015 
OASIS OData TC meeting regarding the goals and accompanying work 
items to focus on over the course of the next 12-18 months:

1.Maintain Standard:
a.Address Errata as they come up
b.Progress OData V4 Errata 2 to ISO
i.Demonstrate interoperability
2.Increase Adoption by:
a.Addressing technical adoption blockers/inhibitors
i.Targeted, highly-compatible OData 4.1 release
ii.JSON format for metadata
iii.Publish vocabulary to describe authentication flows
b.Making OData more approachable through:
i.Publishing a profile for simple REST services
ii.Producing webinars
iii.Publishing samples that begin at a simple starting point and incrementally walk through a scenario 
iv.Publish "Implementing OData" whitepaper
c.Making OData service endpoints more discoverable
i.Establish an OData endpoint registry, for example, on OData.org
3.Extend the Protocol by
a.Publishing Aggregation Extensions for OData
b.Publishing Temporal Extensions for OData
4.Evaluate Performance
a.Is performance suitable for specific scenarios
i.i.e., Bulk-load
b.What optimizations can we apply *where needed*
i.Binary protocol
5.Investigate HTTP 2.0
a.Server PUSH

I suggest that the next step would be to prioritize and assign dates for each of the deliverables.
</pre>
<p>Hubert asks on what security-related topics we want to address</p>
<p>Mike: define a vocabulary for supported authentication methods and flows might need to be part of a Catalog because $metadata access already may require authentication</p>
<p>Mark: split metadata into "server metadata" and "schema metadata"</p>
<p>Mike: authentication is a barrier for interoperability</p>
<p>Mike: need a way to provide generic clients with the necessary information Email from odata-discussion google group on efforts to align Swagger with OData:</p>

Mark Stafford[OData Discussion] Aligning Swagger and OData4/15/201560 KB
We are working really hard to align Swagger and OData. We do sometimes 
forget to update our non-Microsoft friends with where were at, so thanks, 
Josh, for bringing this back up on another thread. Heres our current thinking  
and please take it as current thinking, not roadmap commitments.

We have no philosophical objection to Swagger. Few of us like CSDL as a 
description format, but its clear that for OData to benefit from really 
terse payloads and still have rich support for types, relationships, etc, 
we do need a description of the model somewhere (JSON-LD does the same thing 
so were not alone in seeing this as a necessity).

There are some pretty big gaps at this point, though. Swagger doesnt support 
relationships, doesnt have semantics for query string parameters (so a computer 
cant tell which is the conceptual top parameter), cant tell you where the nextLink 
is in a response, etc. When I was last in the US (February) I had a great face-to-face 
conversation with Tony Tam about these points and Im happy to say that were very 
much on the same page  these would be great additions to Swagger. 
Since the acquisition, SmartBear has expressed similar interest in closing the gap.

The long term vision would be to allow every OData service to be well-described by 
Swagger. I mentioned previously that folks should watch our Github repo for news 
about a modeling tool. The specs for that tool are now 
public (https://github.com/odata/model-first/), and I think wed like to get some 
feedback on our thinking here.

The Swagger editor (http://editor.swagger.io) was what originally inspired us 
to kick off this initiative. We love the idea, but you just have to put so much 
YAML into the tool to get output. OData has a LOT of conventions that would 
theoretically enable you to put in a LOT less YAML in order to get the same amount 
of output, and unlike most Swagger docs, the output would be super consistent. 
So imagine in your head a tool that allows you to just describe the resource model 
for your REST API and the tool supplies the rest of the conventions and allows you 
to output Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, or even eventually scaffold a proper OData service.

For clickstop #1 we are looking to keep things simple. We would support ingesting 
the YAML were proposing and outputting Swagger docs. We understand that wouldnt 
allow rich RESTful APIs to be modeled, but we think its enough to get feedback on 
whether the approach is helpful.

We  of course  think this tool could be pretty amazing, but what we really want 
to hear is what you, the OData community thinks. Thoughts?

(And just to preface any questions, we are  as mentioned  currently talking to the 
Swagger crew and weve kicked off a conversation with CA who seems to have something 
similar going at Who wants to try out an OData Extension. If theres anyone else we 
should work with as well, please feel free to connect me  you can reach me directly 
at mastaffo@microsoft.com.)

Thanks,
Mark
