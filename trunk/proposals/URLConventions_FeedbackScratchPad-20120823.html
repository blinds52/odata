The resource identified by this URL MUST be an AtomPub Service Document (as specified in [RFC5023]) and follow the OData conventions for AtomPub Service Documents (or an alternate representation of an Atom Service Document if a different format is requested). [OData-JSON] specifies such an alternate JSON-based representation of a service document. The service document is required to be returned from the root of an OData service to provide clients with a simple mechanism to enumerate all of the collections of resources available for the data service.</code></p><p>as:</p><p><code>The service root URL identifies the root of an OData service. This URL MUST point to an AtomPub Service Document (as specified in [RFC5023]).</code></p><p><code>Per default this service document MUST follow the OData conventions for AtomPub Service Documents.
