**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

####4.3.7 OData ABNF Construction Rules Version 1.0 Working Draft 01####

Ralf: 
>I **move** to close the action item AI#0012 and approve the [delivered revision of OData ABNF Construction Rules Version 1.0 Working Draft 01](https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/odata/trunk/spec/ABNF/odata-abnf-current.abnf?op=dl&rev=10&isdir=0) specification (as of today, i.e. svn revision 10) as baseline document. (**Martin seconds**).

Discussion of motion:

* Ram asks, if the text format of the ABNF grammar file qualifies as a WD01 document and suggests to put an action on him to further investigate this with the TC administraion.
* Ralf explains, that the grammar is in plain text format, since it is a valid grammar made to be parsed by parsers, i.e. it targets machine readability (eg. as validator definition input)
* Michael adds that it is like with XSD-files in other contexts (CSDL) with the difference, that here the ABNF is the **normative base** for the OData protocol, whilst the XSD file for the CSDL is non-normative.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

Note: 
>The above link to the document revision approved as baseline is a no-frills download link. It is stated to point unambiguously to the exact document. For ongoing work and review it is suggested to visit [OData ABNF Construction Rules Version 1.0 Working Draft 01](https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/odata/trunk/spec/ABNF/odata-abnf-current.abnf?rev=10) instead. This will offer the access to earlier/later revision and diffs.

New Action [AI#0022](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_item.php?action_item_id=3512):

AI#0022
: "Investigate with the TC administraion how to manage the isolated ABNF Grammar artifact in the standardizing process" [owner: Ram Jeyaraman]

## 5. [Press Release](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/email/archives/201208/msg00131.html) (PR) to announce OASIS OData TC##

### 5.1. Note: ###

Last date for providing quotes (by OASIS Sponsor-level members) is Friday Aug 24. The PR is scheduled for release on 2012-Aug-27.


##6. Additional folder (in TC document repository) for proposals, etc##

###6.1 Requirements for additional folders###

Let’s discuss if we need an additional folder for uploading proposals, etc. and decide on the name of such a folder.

Discussion:

* Stefan motivates the need for a folder different from Contributions, where secondary documents like reviews and proposals may reside and suggests "Reviews", "Proposals" or the like.
* Ralf proposes to name the folder Proposals
* Andrew suggests, that the normative text of a proposal or longer comment MAY also go into the Proposals folder and only a summary and corresponding link inside the JIRA Issue.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**.

Ram will rename the folder ["Temporary files"](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/documents.php?folder_id=2681) to "Proposals" (without the quotes).


##7. Next face to face meeting##

###7.1 Discussion of results from [Electronic ballot](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/ballot.php?id=2278)###

>Context: The completed [e-ballot](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/ballot.php?id=2278) on possible dates for the next F2F

Discussion:

* Ram reports result: 
    * October 15-19, 2012 ok for 10 persons 
    * November 5-9, 2012 ok for 20 persons (including the 10 persons voting for the October date) 

Ram suggests the week November 5-9, 2012

**No objections**. Agreed.

Further discussion:

* Andrew would prefer that the meeting occur later in the week of November 5-9, 2012.
* Michael suggests to plan for 3 days instead of only 2 days to account for the tentative volume of work.

###7.2 Host for the upcoming face to face meeting### 

Any volunteers?

Discussion:

* Mark asks for requirements for F2F hosting
* Ram assumes requirements are only:
    * a room for at most 20 members (since not all voting members will be able to participate locally)
    * including a telephone line for hooking the conference system
    * and of course an internet connection (for the chat).


Mark is considering hosting.

Ram suggests to all, that until next meeting there will be definitve a hosting volunteer, so that planning may be progressed further.
