<h4>5.1 OData CSDL</h4>

<h5>5.1.1 ODATA-734 "Unicode Facet is inadequate"</h5>
<p>Ralf: No investigation took place. Hubert to record discussion on this issue in last meeting. </p>
<p>All: Issue postponed to next meeting</p>
<P>Motion passes, no objections</p>

<h5>5.1.2 ODATA-751 "Clarification of Edm.NavigationPropertyPath and Edm.PropertyPath"</h5>
<p>Ralf: Last change to path syntax is not fully reflected in specification text. <br>
Ralf: Change in 14.5.13 the sentence "In contrast to the edmath expression, the value of the edmropertyPath expression is the path itself, not the value of the property identified by the path." to "In contrast to the edmath expression, the value of the edmropertyPath expression is the path itself, not the value of the property or the value of the term cast identified by the path."<br>
Ralf: Change in 14.5.11 "In contrast to the edmath expression, the value of the edm:NavigationPropertyPath expression is the path itself, not the target instance(s) of the navigation property identified by the path." to "In contrast to the edmath expression, the value of the edm:NavigationPropertyPath expression is the path itself, not the instance(s) identified by the path."<br>
Ralf: The last path segment MUST resolve to a navigation property in the context of the preceding path part, or to a term cast where the term MUST be of type Edm.EntityType, a concrete entity type or a collection of Edm.EntityType or concrete entity type.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-751 is open</p>
<p>Hubert: I move to resolve ODATA-751 as proposed. Martin seconds</p>

Ralf: &lt;Duration>P11D23H59M59.999999999999S&lt;/Duration></p>
<p>Martin: &lt;Annotation Term="org.example.task.duration">&lt;Duration>P11DT23H59M59.999999999999S&lt;/Duration>&lt;/Annotation></p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-752 is open</p>

<P>Motion passes, no objections</p>


<h4>5.2 OData JSON Format</h4>

<h5>5.2.1 ODATA-740 "Let's update the GeoJSON reference (again)"</h5>
<p>Stefan: No substantial changes, only rewording and conformance to the IETF publication/review process</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-740 is open</p>
<p>Martin: I move to resolve ODATA-740 as proposed. Stefan seconds</p>
<P>Motion passes, no objections</p>

<h5>5.2.2 ODATA-745 "Sections 4.5.5, 7.3, and 7.4: is odata.nextLink allowed for all collections?"</h5>
<p>Hubert: I move to resolve ODATA-745 as proposed. Martin seconds</p>
<P>Motion passes, no objections</p>

<h5>5.2.3 ODATA-748 "Section 4.5.4: odata.count needs to be allowed for all collections"</h5>

<h4>5.3 OData Protocol</h4>

<h5>5.3.1 ODATA-744 "11.2.3: representation of null for single-valued primitive properties"</h5>
<p>Ralf: {"@odata.context": "$metadata#SomeThings(1)/SomeProperty", "value":null}</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-744 is open</p>
<p>Mike: I move to close ODATA-744 without action as this would make the representation of nulls inconsistent across types and would be a breaking change to the current specification. John seconds</p>
<P>Motion passes, no objections</p>


<h4>5.4 OData URL Conventions</h4>

<h5>5.4.1 ODATA-741 "Mismatch between explanatory text and URL in example 96"</h5>
