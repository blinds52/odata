<h4>5.2 Issues for V4.0_ERRATA03 in New or Open state</h4>

<h5>5.2.1 ODATA-770 "18.2: incomplete description of annotation name format"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-770 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: The name is the same as the name of the name/value pair being annotated, followed by the at sign (@), followed by the namespace- or alias-qualified name of the annotation, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the term. The namespace or alias MUST be defined in the metadata document, see [OData-CSDL].</p>
<p>Ralf: The name is the same as the name of the name/value pair being annotated, followed by the at sign (@), followed by the namespace- or alias-qualified name of the annotation, i.e. the namespace or alias of the schema that defines the term, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the term. The namespace or alias MUST be defined in the metadata document, see [OData-CSDL].</p>
<p>Ralf: diff: , i.e. the namespace or alias of the schema that defines the term,</p>
<p>Mike: Revised wording: The name is the same as the name of the name/value pair being annotated, followed by the at sign (@), followed by the namespace- or alias-qualified name of the term. The namespace or alias MUST be defined in the metadata document, see [OData-CSDL].</p>
<p>Mike: Further revised: The name is the same as the name of the property or name/value pair being annotated, followed by the at sign (@), followed by the namespace- or alias-qualified name of the term. The namespace or alias MUST be defined in the metadata document, see [OData-CSDL].</p>
<p>Mike: I move to resolve ODATA-770 as proposed with the revised wording. John seconds</p>
<P>ODATA-770 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h5>5.2.2 ODATA-771 "Exponential notation for Edm.Decimal values in JSON payloads"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-771 is OPEN</p>
<p>Mike: seems valid, but look into existing implementations to see how they would deal with this in JSON payloads and URLs</p>
<p>Mike and Ralf: look into implementations</p>
<p>Mike: added a comment to issue - a minute ago As per 2015-2-5 meeting: <br>
 Inclination is to make this clarification for JSON payloads, and to add a suggestion to service implementers in URL Conventions and ABNF that they should support this in URLs, but we want to verify behavior of existing implementations.</p>


<h5>5.2.3 ODATA-773 "Qualifiers for instance annotations: JSON Format"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-773 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: @namespace.term</p>
<p>Ralf: @namespace.term#qualifier</p>
<p>Ralf: CSDL uses the hash to separate the qualifier</p>
<p>Ralf: If a path segment starts with an at (@) character, it represents a term cast. The at (@) character MUST be followed by a QualifiedName that MAY be followed by a hash (#) character and a SimpleIdentifier. The QualifiedName preceding the hash character MUST resolve to a term that is in scope, the SimpleIdentifier following the hash sign is interpreted as a Qualifier for the term.</p>
<p>Mike: I move to resolve ODATA-773 as proposed. Stefan seconds</p>
<P>ODATA-773 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h5>5.2.4 ODATA-774 "Qualifiers for annotations: Preference odata.include-annotations"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-774 is OPEN</p>
<p>Mike: what if existing implementations don't expect a qualifier</p>
<p>Mike: look into existing implementations</p>
<P>Revisit in next meeting</p>


<h5>5.2.5 ODATA-479 "Allow Content-ID referencing in request bodies for inserting links to newly created entities"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-479 is OPEN</p>
<p>Mike: establish pattern without forcing servers to implement it</p>
<p>Mike: add it to Errata03 as a MAY</p>
<p>Mike: consider extending the Capabilities vocabulary</p>
<p>Mike: Added to Issue: As per 2015-2-5 meeting: We would like to introduce this pattern as one that services MAY support in Errata 3. We would like to investigate addition of a capability that services can use to advertise support for this pattern.</p>
<P>Revisit in next meeting</p>


<h5>5.2.6 ODATA-776 "Clarify function invocation"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-776 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: Ralf to add concrete proposal and suggests to revisit next week</p>
<p>Ralf: Clarify description of function (import) invocation, especially <br>
 - non-composable functions only support GET, function must be last path segment <br>
 - composable functions allow additional path segments, last path segment determines allowed HTTP verbs, e.g. POST if last segment is multi-valued navigation property etc.</p>

<p>Mike: I propose we go ahead and approve ODATA-776 and give direction to the editors to construct the appropriate wording that we review when we review it in the applied state.</p>
<p>Mike: I move to resolve ODATA-776 as proposed. Matt seconds</p>
<P>ODATA-776 is resolved as proposed</p>
