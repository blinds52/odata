##Date of Errata: 2013-01-11 

#Disposition of ODATA-144

References to report of that error:

* "Disposition of ODATA-144" as reported/clarified by Ralf in a message to the officers of OData TC on 2013-01-11 and upon request by Ram.

##Section 13.4 should read (correct):

###13.4 [ODATA-144](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-144)###

ODATA-144
: "'Scoping' syntax for $select and $aggregate" [component: OData URL Conventions] is **New**. 

Discussion:
* New comment created during meeting (2012-11-09) by Mike in updating the proposal saying that the issue (as before the meeting) is no longer relevant

Hubert: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-144 as proposed. **Ralf seconds**.


**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.


ODATA-144
: "'Scoping' syntax for $select and $aggregate" [component: OData URL Conventions] is **Proposed** with no objections. 


##i.e. with PostMotionStatus "Proposed" instead of "Closed"

#End of Errata
