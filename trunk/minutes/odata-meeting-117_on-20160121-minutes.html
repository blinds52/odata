<h3>7. Issue Processing</h3>

<h4>7.1 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-891" target="_blank">ODATA-891</a> - Misleading reference to "open" in description of $select [New][Proposed]</h4>

<p><b>Ralf</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-891 as proposed. <b>Hubert</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ram: No objections, motion passes.</p>

<h4>7.2 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-892" target="_blank">ODATA-892</a> - Clarify dynamic properties support in $filter, $orderby, $expand [New][Proposed]</h4>

<p>Mike: Clarification: at any point in the path, if a segment does not match a member of the previous segment, then the type of the previous segment must allow dynamic properties.</p>

<p>Ram: Separate issue will be created for whether dynamic navigation property can be created.</p>

<p><b>Ralf</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-892 as proposed. <b>Mike</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ram: No objections, motion passes.</p>

<h4>7.3 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-886" target="_blank">ODATA-886</a> - Need a stable reference to latest/current OASIS OData vocabularies  [Open] [Proposed]</h4>
<p>Ram: Left open. Ram to put together the document based on the template.</p>

<h4>7.4 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-885" target="_blank">ODATA-885</a> - Permissions should apply to more than just properties [Open]</h4>

<p>Mike: Proposal:<br>
Add to AppliesTo: PrimitiveType, ComplexType, TypeDefinition, EntitySet, NavigationProperty, Action, Function <br>
Add "Invoke" to the Permissions enum<br>
Clarify that Invoke can not be combined with any of the other flags.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Hubert</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-885 as per the revised proposal. <b>Ralf</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ram: No objections, motion passes.</p>

<h4>7.5 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-896" target="_blank">ODATA-896</a> - Reconsider guidance on odata.count position (public comment c201512e00001) [New]</h4>

<p>Mike: For Errata, all we can do is clarify that the restriction is only valid for odata.streaming=true responses.<br>
For 4.01 we could consider allowing to be at the end, but in that case there is very little use as the client could simply count themselves.<br>
Note that count is allowed to be approximate.<br>
</p>

<p>Mike: For Errata 3: clarify that ordering constraint is only enforced for odata.streaming=true.<br>
Also make sure that, even for odata.streaming=false, the odata.count must be written on the first page.<br>
</p>

<p>Mike: Proposal:<br>
For Errata 3: clarify that ordering constraint is only enforced for odata.streaming=true.<br>
For server-driven paging, for odata.streaming=false, the odata.count must be written on at least the first page and may put it on subsequent pages (and may vary from page to page).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Ralf</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-896 as proposed. <b>Martin</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ram: No objections, motion passes.</p>

<h4>7.6 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-899" target="_blank">ODATA-899</a> - Type cast segment after $all [New][Proposed]</h4>

<p>Ram: ACTION: Open an issue to clarify precedence of spec artifacts</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we approve ODATA-899 as proposed. <b>Hubert</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ram: No objections, motion passes.</p>

<p>Gerald: I drafted a solution proposal: <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/57355/Index-Based%20Operations%20on%20Collections.docx" target="_blank">https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/57355/Index-Based%20Operations%20on%20Collections.docx</a></p>
