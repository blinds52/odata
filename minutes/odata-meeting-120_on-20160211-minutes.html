<p>Ram: Ram to request starter docs for v4.01</p>


<h3>5. Issue Processing</h3>

<p>Ram: Gerald walks through the latest proposal on set operations (index based collections): <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/57438/2016-01-29%20Index-Based%20Operations%20on%20Collections.docx" target="_blank">https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/57438/2016-01-29%20Index-Based%20Operations%20on%20Collections.docx</a></p>
<p>Ram: There is consensus building on the proposal with respect to primitive types, but the group decided to wait until we have consensus on how to treat entity type collections.</p>
<p>Ram: This will be tackled at the F2F.</p>
<p>Ram: On to issues on Simplified Syntax: Proposal by Mike Pizzo: OData 4.1 URL Syntax Simplification Proposal</p>

<h4>Errata 03 issues</h4>
<p>Ram: Editors to get the Errata03 docs ready for review and approval as CSD01.</p>

<h4>5.1 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-886" target="_blank">ODATA-886</a> - Need a stable reference to latest/current OASIS OData vocabularies</h4>
<p>Ram: We will wait for the vocabularies doc to be available (Action: Ram)</p>

<h4>5.2 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-903" target="_blank">ODATA-903</a> - ABNF: should allow cast segment following collection of complex types</h4>
<p>Ram: Issue is now open. No objections.</p>
<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-903 as proposed. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Motion passes, no objections, ODATA-903 is resolved as proposed.</p>

<h4>5.3 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-763" target="_blank">ODATA-763</a> - Allowing implicit aliasing of parameters (public comment c201412e00001)</h4>
<p>Ram: ODATA-763 is now open. No objections.</p>
<p>Mike: Revised proposal: Support only when the function/action is the last segment:
<br>
A service may support invoking a function as the last segment in a path by omitting the parens and supplying the named parameters as query options prefixed with the "@" sign (ODATA-763 and ODATA-644). For maximum interoperability, services must continue to support the parens syntax as well.
<br>
Precedence rules apply for cases where the function name conflicts with a property name. In particular, the declared property wins over a function, and a function would win over a dynamic property.
</p>
<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-763 as proposed. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Motion passes, no objections, ODATA-763 has been resolved.</p>

<h4>5.4 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-664" target="_blank">ODATA-664</a> - Consider supporting parameterless function imports with no parens</h4>
<p>Ram: Issue open, no objections</p>
<p>Mike: Revised proposed wording: For function imports (only), if there are no parameters the service may support an alternate syntax of omitting the parens. For maximum interoperability, the service must still support calling function imports with the parens.</p>
<p>Mike: Further revised: For function imports with no parameters the service may support an alternate syntax of omitting the parens. For maximum interoperability, the service must still support calling function imports with the parens.</p>

<p><b>Mark</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-664 as proposed. <b>Ted</b> seconds.</p> 
<p>Motion passes, no objections, ODATA-664 has been resolved as proposed.</p>

<h4>5.5 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-881" target="_blank">ODATA-881</a> - Add support for Edm.Untyped</h4>
<p>Ram: Issue needs further contemplation.</p>
