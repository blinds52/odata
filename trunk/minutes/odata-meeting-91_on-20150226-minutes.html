<h4>4.1 Action items due by February 26, 2015</h4>

<h5>4.1.1 Follow up with JSON-Schema on use for modeling</h5>
<p>Mike started investigation, follow-up on next meeting</p>

<h3>5. Process issues (for V4.0_ERRATA03 in New or Open state)</h3>

<h4>5.1 OData ABNF</h4>

<h5>5.1.1 ODATA-783 "Is it intentional that mindatetime/maxdatetime/now don't permit %-encoded parentheses in ABNF?"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-783 is OPEN</p>
<p>Mark: I move to resolve OData-783 to allow %encoding paraenthesis for minDatetime, maxdatetime and now functions. John seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-783 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h5>5.1.2 ODATA-782 "Example 57: choose better example"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-782 is OPEN</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Chat trace available to scribe hat a gap, motion to ODATA-782 missing - for now</b>
<p>ODATA-782: resolved</p>

<h5>5.1.3 ODATA-771 "Exponential notation for Edm.Decimal values in JSON payloads"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-771 is OPEN</p>

<p>ODATA-771: postponed</p>

<h5>5.1.4 ODATA-479 "Allow Content-ID referencing in request bodies for inserting links to newly created entities"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-479 is OPEN</p>

<p>ODATA-479: postponed</p>

<h5>5.1.5 ODATA-778 "Example in section 11.7.3.1, 'Referencing Requests in a Change Set', should use JSON, not ATOM"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-778 is OPEN</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Chat trace available to scribe hat a gap, motion to ODATA-778 missing - for now</b>

<p>ODATA-778: resolved</p>

<h5>5.1.6 ODATA-777 "Clarify multiply/divide duration by number"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-777 is OPEN</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Chat trace available to scribe hat a gap, motion to ODATA-777 missing - for now</b>

<p>ODATA-777: resolved</p>


<h5>5.1.7 ODATA-780 "indexof: what to return if the second argument does not appear in the first argument"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-780 is OPEN</p>
<p>Hubert: I move to resolve ODATA-780 as proposed. Ramesh seconds</p>

<p>Motion carries, ODATA-780 is resolved as proposed.</p>


<h5>5.1.8 ODATA-781 "substring: what to return if the start index is outside the first argument string, or the desired length exceeds the remaining string length"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-781 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ramesh: should not return null. it could be valid value</p>
<p>Hubert: check with SQL what it does, null or empty string, don't like "bad request"</p>
<p>Ralf: Reserve "bad request" for negative start index or length, both never make sense</p>
<p>Mike: desired length exceeds remaining string length just leads to a shorter result</p>
<p>Mark: Java defines this as error conditions.  From the documentationIndexOutOfBoundsException - if the beginIndex is negative, or endIndex is larger than the length of this String object, or beginIndex is larger than endIndex.</p>
<p>Ramesh: I agree that if SQL ref returns empty or null then that is fine. I am also checking SQL Spec. orcacle: http://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/functions/substr.php</p>
<p>Ralf: Negative start index could be treated as counting from the end of the string, i.e. substring(X,-3) gives the last three characters</p>
<p>Ralf: DB2 will return empty string of start &gt; length</p>
<p>Ralf: DB2 will return error if start &lt; 0</p>
<p>Ralf: SQL Anywhere treats negative start as "start from beginning"</p>
<p>Ralf: SQL Anywhere returns empty string as start &gt; length</p>
<p>Mike: return empty string if start &gt; length</p>
<p>Mike: return remaining characters if desired length exceeds string length</p>
<p>Mike: explicitly "unspecify" behavior for negative start index</p>
<p>Mike: Proposal:<br>
-Empty string should be returned for an index larger than the length of the string.<br>
-Length too long should be allowed and return as many characters up to the specified length.<br>
-The behavior for a negative index is undefined.<br>
-A negative length is a bad request.</p>

<p>Mark: I move to resolve ODATA-781 as proposed. Matt seconds</p>

<p>Motion carries, ODATA-781 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h5>5.1.9 ODATA-784 "Need to specify the behaviour of arithmetic operators on Decimal type"</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-784 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: If A and B are values of type decimal, with scales scaleof(A) and scaleof(B), then: <br>
<br>
 scaleof(A add B) = max(scaleof(A), scaleof(B)) <br>
 scaleof(A sub B) = max(scaleof(A), scaleof(B)) <br>
 scaleof(A mul B) = scaleof(A) + scaleof(B) <br>
 scaleof(A div B) = scaleof(A) + scaleof(B)<br></p>
<p>Ralf: 1 div 3 add 2 div 3</p>
<p>Ralf: Rules 1-3 are straight-forward</p>
<p>Ralf: Precision for add also might need to be increased by 1</p>
<p>Mike: to what extent do we need to specify this?</p>
<p>Mike: Questions brought up:</p>
<p>Mike: To what extent do we need to specify this?<br>
Can we say the result is a decimal of sufficient scale?<br>
Is it dependent upon the defined scale of the data types or the actual numbers?<br>
If the expression is used in a $filter, and some of the operands result in an overflow and some do not, how is that handled?<br></p>
<p>Ralf: Whole request needs to fail if computation fails for an instance</p>

<p>Postponed to next meeting</p>

<h5>5.1.10 ODATA-785 "Numeric promotion (on overflow) across "number type families" is undesirable."</h5>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-785 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: Proposal<br>
<br>
<br>
Expressly disallow numeric promotion (on overflow) across number type families. <br>
<br>
 Expressly disallow numeric promotion (on overflow) between Single and Double. <br>
<br>
 The remaining legal option would be numeric promition on overflow only for integer types.<br></p>
<p>Ralf: Concern that this would change normative parts of the specification</p>
<p>Ralf: Clients are probably not concerned about current rules</p>
<p>Ralf: Servers may find it difficult to follow current rules</p>
<p>Ralf: Research required</p>

<p>Postponed to next meeting</p>
