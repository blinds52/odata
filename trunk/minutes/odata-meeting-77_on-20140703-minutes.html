<li><a href="https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-712">ODATA-712</a>: In chapter 10 we missed to spell out various Context URL templates.</li>

<li><a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-631">ODATA-631</a>: How do annotations that target entity sets work against singletons/containment?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ralf</b>: I move to resolve ODATA-707, ODATA-712, ODATA-713, and ODATA-716 as proposed.</p>
<p>Martin seconds</p>

<p>No objections and no more discussions, the motion carries ODATA-707, ODATA-712, ODATA-713, and ODATA-716 are now resolved as proposed.</p>



<h5>5.1.1 ODATA-685 is already OPEN and RESOLVED</h5>
<p>Mike summarizes the issue</p>
<p>ODATA-685 has already been resolved on June, 12</p>

<h5>5.1.2 ODATA-707 is already OPEN</h5>
<p>Mike summarizes the issue</p>
<p>Martin: Text is now: "Numeric values have a first-class representation in JSON but are not further distinguished, so they include an odata.type annotation unless their type is Double."</p>

<h5>5.1.3 ODATA-712 is already OPEN</h5>
<p>Mike summarizes the issue and this is ready for motion</p>

<h5>5.1.4 ODATA-713 is OPEN</h5>
<p>Mike summarizes the issue and this is ready for motion</p>

<h5>5.1.5 ODATA-716 is OPEN</h5>
<p>Mike summarizes that this issue is ready for resolution as well after Mike updates the proposal and Ralf has rolled back changes already made and not aligned with the proposed resolution as discussed during the meeting</p>
<p>Mike states the revised proposal: "Call out that If-Match only makes sense for operations on existing entities (update, delete). Doing a PUT/PATCH with no If-Match fails if the entity requires an ETag and already exists. Doing a PUT/PATCH with no If-Match can still be processed as an insert if the entity does not exist."</p>

<h5>5.1.6 ODATA-631 is OPEN (noted in JIRA as applied)</h5>
<p>Mike explains, that ODATA-700 clarifies the path syntax for the annotation element, ODATA-631 clarifies this for other elemnts (ie. non containment properties).</p>
<p>All discuss what parts shall be submitted to ISO and which will remain part of OASIS spec to keep eg. the vocabulary URLs stable and flexibly update the vocabularies in short cycles, as they are exactly designed to inject flexibility into the OData cosmos</p>

<p>All agree, that we will tackle ODATA-631 as part of OData v4.1</p>

<h6>5.1.6.1 No other issues</h6>

<h4>5.2 OData v4 applied resolutions:</h4>

<p>The TC is reviewing the application of the resolutions since last F2F meeting in a live shared document walk through</p>

<h3>6. Next meeting planned for Jul, 10 2014</h3>

<p>Agreed</p>

<h3>7. AOB</h3>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I would like to acknowledge Ram Jeyaraman who was this week elected as an OASIS Distinguished Contributor based on his ability to introduce new work, his influence and visibility in the industry, his ability to build consensus, and his leadership and service.<br>

<p>All acknowledge Rams achievements and congratulate him on the nomination</p>

<h3>Meeting adjourned at 10:12 PDT</h3>
