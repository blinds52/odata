##5 Review of [Issues List](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&pid=10103&sorter/field=issuekey&sorter/order=ASC) (IL) and Progress

**Note on the format**: We minute an issue state progression as an ordered triple consisting of:

1. The initial issue summary (including its status **before** the meeting)
2. Discussion content and decisions i.e. **formally required motion text** potentially _overriding a proposed solution (of the issue's instance in JIRA)_ at the time of the meeting.
3. The resulting issue summary (including its updated status _plus eventual modifications linking to the motion text_  **after** the meeting)

The rationale behind this is: a) to **document the initial status** - _which may well deviate from the (tentative) status set inside the instance in JIRA at that time_, b) to **optimize the transfer of changes resulting from the discussion back into the issue's instance inside JIRA** (if dictated by the accepted motion) and last but not least c) to **ease the lookup** for the reader.

The value of the main status is one (_and only one_) from the set (**New**, **Open**, **Deferred**, **Proposed**, **Resolved**, **Applied** or **Closed**) as documented in "[Best Practices for Issue Handling](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47021/Best%20Practices%20for%20Issue%20Handling%20v9.docx)", where the states and transitions are further explained as they have been adopted by the TC.

A step by step recipe on how to apply these resolutions to new revisions of work products is given in "[How to Apply Resolved Issues](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47018/How%20to%20Apply%20Resolved%20Issues.docx)" and shall assist the editors performing the many formally necessary (but often _purely mechanical_) steps needing attention along the way.
