<h2>5. "swaggerized" JSON CSDL</h2>
<h3>5.1 Preview of "swaggerized" JSON CSDL example files and explain the differences</h3>
<p>Ralf  presents the swaggerized JSON CSDL example and highlights what's new</p>
<p>Mike: Thought: perhaps we should provide a service that can generate the path portion of a swagger document given the definitions section. Then, if swagger tools support $ref for the body of the path property, services could put a ref to that service, with a query option pointing back to their definitions document, that would automatically generate the paths section based on that document.</p>
<p>Mark: I had a similar thought.  I was wondering whether the service could tell if the client was a swagger client and generate the path section for a swagger client and have it empty or omitted for a non-swagger client</p>

<p>Ram: ACTION (Ram): Identify the right open source license for the OASIS Open Source repositories for vocabularies and libraries</p>
<p>Ralf: Open Repository on GitHub for Vocabulary evolution: Ram to find out which Open Source license is compatible with our TC IPR mode</p>


<h2>6. V4.01 issues - Issues for V4.01_WD01 in New or Open state</h2>
<h3>6.1 Set Operations</h3>

<h4>6.1.1 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-876" target="_blank">ODATA-876</a> - Allow services to return contained entities inline for delta responses</h4>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-876 as proposed. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Motion passes, no objections. ODATA-876 is RESOLVED as proposed.</p>

<h4>6.1.2 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-666" target="_blank">ODATA-666</a> - Define Deep Update and Deep Upsert operations</h4>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-666 as proposed. <b>Gerald</b> seconds.</p>
<p>No objections. ODATA-666 is RESOLVED as proposed.</p>


<h4>6.1.3 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-613" target="_blank">ODATA-613</a> - Allow POST to entity sets using the delta-response</h4>

<p>Ram: PATCH operation is neither safe or idempotent</p>
<p>Ram: PATCH operation should be executed atomically</p>
<p>Mike: Propose that Response, if requested, should be a delta representation, in the same structure and order as the request payload, representing changes. This means that the response has to be constructed as the request is processed, not generated from an after-image.</p>
<p>Mike: updated proposal from issue: PATCH to a collection of entities can take a delta payload (interpreted as deltas if body represents a collection of entities) ODATA-613
a.MUST NOT have $filter, $select, $orderby, etc. <br>
For PATCH, you don't specify a $expand so the extent of that graph is undefined.  Therefore, it is valid to have added/deleted links to anything (at least anything reachable from the target; service probably wouldn't bother validating).  So Clients SHOULD make sure added/deleted links are reachable from target, but clients need not validate.<br> 
Response, if requested, should be a delta representation, in the same structure and order as the request payload, representing changes.</p>
