Thanks a lot for providing this first draft, Mike! 

As already practiced with the other document revision issues, I prefer to put my complete feedback of the first iteration into one comment, so that you may consider it as a whole and we do not drown in a flood of minor issues on a phrase level of the documents. 

If there is interest in or objection against specific feedback items, I will be happy to invest the extra work and pull these into dedicated JIRA issues. 

Comments are structured by bracketing the location range in the document revision [OData URL Conventions Version 1.0 Working Draft 01](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/46751/odata-url-conventions-v1.0-wd01-2012-08-22.doc) and then detailing this in globally enumerated feedback items (currently A-B). 


Review iteration is paused.

#2 URL Components#

##Feedback A)##

The second of the two examples after:

`The following are two example URLs broken down into their component parts:`

does not show the alignment between the sample url and the illustrative range bracketing and labeling.

This **SHOULD** be rearranged.

Benefit is `readability`

##Feedback B)##

Since the subsequent chapters 3,4 and 5 are covering the three main components of a URL as introduced in this chapter (2), a guiding sentence should be amendend after the example in the line of:

`Mandated and suggested content of these three significant URL components used by an OData service are covered in sequence in the three following chapters.`

Benefit is `clarity and readability`.
