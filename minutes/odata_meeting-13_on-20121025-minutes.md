#####6.2.5.1 [ODATA-132](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-132)#####

ODATA-132
: "Support /$count in $select, $filter and $orderby" [components: OData ABNF Construction Rules, OData ATOM Format, OData JSON Format, OData Protocol, OData URL Conventions] is **new**. 

Discussion:

* Ralf summarizes
* Mike likes the idea of using $orderby etc. but asks as in his comment If we support $count in $select we need to specify how the count is returned. For example, for ATOM, is it returned as a property, a new property, an instance annotation, or using the <m:count> element. Adding it as a property has issues with the result no longer matching the type defined in metadata (which would not have count defined). Similarly for JSON, is it returned as a property, in a __metadata property, as __count, or through an instance annotation?
* Mikes second paragraph in comment: This should also be considered in conjunction with incoming aggregation proposal, as $count is a type of aggregation on the collection, and it's unclear without understanding the broader proposal whether $count should be handled differently from other aggregations. 
* Ralf thinks that these terms are to be distinguished (as brought out in preparation of the data aggregation paper)
* Mike likes the idea, but is not sure, if he likes the proposed syntax
* Ralf suggests alternate syntax handling
* Mike is ok with moving forward with supporting /$count et al.
* Hubert asks on details of interpretation when adding specific info combined with /$count

Mike: 
>I **move** we resolve odata-132 as proposed for $filter and $orderby only, and defer handling of returning the count. **Martin seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.


ODATA-132

ODATA-36
: "Make $expand implicit if navigation properties are mentioned in $select or $aggregate" [components: OData Protocol, OData URL Conventions] is **new**. 

Discussion:

**No further discussion**. **No objections**.
