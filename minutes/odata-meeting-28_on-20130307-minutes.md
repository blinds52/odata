###5.1 Issues in Applied state that need to be re-discussed (requested by editors)

####5.1.1 [ODATA-258](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-258)

ODATA-258:
: "Advertise function imports in service document" [components: OData CSDL, OData ATOM Format, OData JSON Format] is **Resolved**.

Discussion:

* Ralf explains, that after havin inspected a full service document with the changes applied, the title tag did not resonate well with the atom spec.
* Requested by Mike, Ralf issues a sample for it:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <app:service xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
                  xmlns:metadata="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/metadata"
          >
          <app:workspace>
            <atom:title type="text">Data</atom:title>
            <app:collection href="Airlines">
              <atom:title type="text">Very Important Airlines</atom:title>
            </app:collection>
            <app:collection href="Flights">
              <atom:title type="text">Flights</atom:title>
            </app:collection>
            <metadata:entity title="ALFKI" href="ALFKI" />
            <metadata:function-import title="TopAirlines" href="TopAirlines" />
          </app:workspace>
          <atom:link rel="self" href="http://host:port/AirlineService;v=42/" />
          <atom:link rel="latest-version" href="http://host:port/AirlineService;v=42/" />
        </app:service>

* All agree, that in both relevant use cases title should become a child element instead.

Ralf: 
>I **move** to amend the proposal for ODATA-258 by using an atom:title child element for metadata:entity and metadata:function-import instead of the title attribute. **Mike seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

ODATA-258:
: "Advertise function imports in service document" [components: OData CSDL, OData ATOM Format, OData JSON Format] is **Resolved as noted in the motion** with no objections.

* Mike also has an additional question: if this is handled as an insert, should the result be what is typically returned by an insert or an update?
* Mike suggests to take this offline
