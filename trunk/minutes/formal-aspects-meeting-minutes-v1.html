<p>Action items are referenced by their local ID as generated by the Kavi-Tool upon creation. This ID consists of the constant string <strong>AI#</strong> and an automatically incremented number padded to the left with zeros and to 4 digits like eg. <strong>AI#0123</strong>.</p>

<p>The ownership of action items is noted <code>[owner: Given Family]</code> and as indicated by the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_items.php">AI-List-Tool</a>. Additionally the time stamp of retrieval is given in the preamble.</p>

<h2 id="linkingtoaiprogressionsectionsinmeetingminutes">1.1 Linking to AI progression sections in meeting minutes</h2>

<p>The linkage to the documentation of an action items specific state progression inside meeting minutes SHOULD be provided through a publicly accessible URL of the meeting minutes. To ease the navigation for the reader this link MAY have a fractional part which is the <strong>lowercased</strong> action items ID where the <strong>&#8217;#&#8217;sign has of course been stripped</strong>. For meeting minutes this fractional target is guaranteed to point to the relevant subsection of the minutes.</p>

<p>As an example, for linking the action item <strong>AI#0005</strong> to its state progression (from &#8216;<strong>Ongoing</strong> (Note: Due 2013–01–10)&#8217; to &#8216;<strong>Ongoing</strong> (Note: Due 2013–01–31)&#8217;) during meeting#20 the specific public URL is (fractional part=&#8217;ai0005&#8217;):</p>

<p>Issues are referenced by their local ID as generated by JIRA upon creation. This ID consists of the constant string <strong>ODATA-</strong> and an automatically incremented number like eg. <strong>ODATA&#8211;123</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="notationofissuestateprogressionsduringmeetings">2.1 Notation of Issue State Progressions during Meetings</h3>

<p>We minute an issue state progression as an ordered triple consisting of:</p>

<ol>
<li>The initial issue summary (including its status <strong>before</strong> the meeting)</li>
<li>Discussion content and decisions i.e. <strong>formally required motion text</strong> potentially <em>overriding a proposed solution (of the issue&#8217;s instance in JIRA)</em> at the time of the meeting.</li>
<li>The resulting issue summary (including its updated status <em>plus eventual modifications linking to the motion text</em> <strong>after</strong> the meeting)</li>
</ol>

<p>The rationale behind this is: a) to <strong>document the initial status</strong> - <em>which may well deviate from the (tentative) status set inside the instance in JIRA at that time</em>, b) to <strong>optimize the transfer of changes resulting from the discussion back into the issue&#8217;s instance inside JIRA</strong> (if dictated by the accepted motion) and last but not least c) to <strong>ease the lookup</strong> for the reader.</p>

<p>The value of the main status is one (<em>and only one</em>) from the set (<strong>New</strong>, <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Deferred</strong>, <strong>Proposed</strong>, <strong>Resolved</strong>, <strong>Applied</strong> or <strong>Closed</strong>) as documented in &#8220;<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47021/Best%20Practices%20for%20Issue%20Handling%20v9.docx">Best Practices for Issue Handling</a>&#8221;, where the states and transitions are further explained as they have been adopted by the TC.</p>

<p>A step by step recipe on how to apply these resolutions to new revisions of work products is given in &#8220;<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47018/How%20to%20Apply%20Resolved%20Issues.docx">How to Apply Resolved Issues</a>&#8221; and shall assist the editors performing the many formally necessary (but often <em>purely mechanical</em>) steps needing attention along the way.</p>

<h3 id="lifecycleofmainstreamissues">2.2 Lifecycle of &#8216;Mainstream&#8217; Issues</h3>

<p>For the purpose of this section any issue that results in an implemented change will be considered a &#8216;mainstream&#8217; issue. The typical lifecycle of such an issue and with focus on the relation between actions, status and documentation in meeting minutes may be illustrated as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Created as <strong>New</strong> by Reporter -&gt; <strong>New</strong> [+ Comments]</li>
<li>[optional as step 2] The <strong>Proposed</strong> flag can be set during <strong>New</strong> discussions to indicate that the issues&#8217; proposal is ready for resolution. <em>If and only if this is the case, then the steps labelled 3 and 4 may be skipped. In all other cases the step labelled 4 will be mandatory</em>.</li>
<li>Accepted as <strong>Open</strong> by TC -&gt; <strong>Open</strong> [+ Discussions [+ Motion [+ Amendment] ] ]</li>
<li>[optional as step 4, but mandatory as status] The <strong>Proposed</strong> flag can be set during <strong>Open</strong> discussions to indicate that a proposal is ready for resolution. <em>Only ready to implemented proposals will be resolved by the TC</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Resolved</strong> as Proposed by TC -&gt; <strong>Resolved</strong></li>
<li>Implementation during work phase visible to the editor.</li>
<li>Signalled as <strong>Applied</strong> by Editor -&gt; <strong>Applied</strong> [+ Discussions [+ Motion [+ Amendment] ] ]</li>
<li><strong>Closed</strong> as Applied by TC -&gt; <strong>Closed</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The relation of incoming and outgoind issues states is further listed and explained in the following subsection. Any remaining details on available issue states and transitions may be found in &#8220;<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47021/Best%20Practices%20for%20Issue%20Handling%20v9.docx">Best Practices for Issue Handling</a>&#8221;.</p>

<h4 id="relationofincomingandoutgoingissuestates">2.2.1 Relation of Incoming and Outgoing Issue States</h4>

<p>The issues that are put on a TC meeting agenda MUST have one of the three following incoming states: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>New+Proposed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Open+Proposed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Applied</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>For each of those incoming issue states, the corresponding possible outgoing states - amended with explanations (<em>noted in parentheses</em>) - are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Incoming state: <strong>New+Proposed</strong> implies the possible outgoing states:

<ol>
<li><strong>New+Proposed</strong> (<em>TC did not act on this</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Open+Proposed</strong> (<em>TC agreed to open but has not resolved yet</em>),</li>
<li><strong>New</strong> (<em>TC removed the issue from Proposed since the proposal was not complete</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Open</strong> (<em>TC accepted the issue but removed the issue from Proposed since the proposal was not complete</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Resolved</strong> (<em>successfully resolved</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Closed</strong> (<em>TC closed issue with no further action</em>).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Incoming state: <strong>Open+Proposed</strong> implies the possible outgoing states:

<ol>
<li><strong>Open+Proposed</strong> (<em>TC did not act on this</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Open</strong> (<em>TC accepted the issue but removed the issue from Proposed since the proposal was not complete</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Resolved</strong> (<em>successfully resolved</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Closed</strong> (<em>TC closed issue with no further action</em>).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Incoming state: <strong>Applied</strong> implies the possible outgoing states:

<ol>
<li><strong>Resolved</strong> (<em>if the TC disagrees with the application of the resolution</em>),</li>
<li><strong>Closed</strong> (<em>TC agrees with the application of the resolution</em>).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="linkingfromjiraissuestostateprogressionsectionsinmeetingminutes">2.3 Linking from JIRA issues to state progression sections in meeting minutes</h2>

<p>The linkage from the representation of an issue as noted in JIRA to the documentation of its specific state progression inside meeting minutes SHOULD be provided through a publicly accessible URL of the meeting minutes. To ease the navigation for the reader this link MAY have a fractional part which is the <strong>lowercased</strong> issues ID. For meeting minutes this fractional target is guaranteed to point to the relevant subsection of the minutes.</p>

<p>As an example, for linking the issue <strong>ODATA&#8211;13</strong> to its state progression (from <strong>New</strong> to <strong>New+Proposed</strong>) during meeting#20 the specific public URL is (fractional part=&#8217;odata&#8211;13&#8217;):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47861/odata-meeting-20_on-20130110-minutes.html#odata-13">https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47861/odata-meeting&#8211;20_on&#8211;20130110-minutes.html#odata&#8211;13</a></p>

<p>The corresponding private URL (only visible to TC members) would be:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47861/latest/odata-meeting-20_on-20130110-minutes.html#odata-13">https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47861/latest/odata-meeting&#8211;20_on&#8211;20130110-minutes.html#odata&#8211;13</a> </p>

<p>As we tend to keep the filenames persistent, one can usually build the public from the private URL by</p>

<ol>
<li>replacing &#8216;apps/org/workgroup/odata/&#8217; with &#8216;committees/&#8217; and</li>
<li>removing &#8216;latest/&#8217;</li>
</ol>

<p>Thereby we maximize the public navigation experience throughout our documentation.</p>

<h2 id="issuesrelatedtopubliccomments">2.4 Issues related to Public Comments</h2>

<p>If an issue created in JIRA is related to a public comment (eg. because it has been accepted as an issue by the TC) the subject of the JIRA issue should follow the format as described in section [<a href="#ci_indicator">3.2</a>].</p>

<h2 id="pcnotation">3 Notation of Public Comments and Relations to Minutes and Issues</h2>

<p>Public comments are referenced by their local ID pair as generated by the OASIS mailing list archiver upon receipt. The derived ID consists of the string literal <strong>c</strong> the &#8216;YYYYMM&#8217; string from the year month folder, the string literal <strong>e</strong> and automatically incremented number padded to the left with zeros and to 5 digits like eg. <strong>c201301e00001</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="linkingfrompubliccommentstoprocessingsectionsinmeetingminutes">3.1 Linking from Public Comments to processing sections in meeting minutes</h2>

<p>Abiding the rules of OASIS all comments are acknowledged and considered. So every comment received through the single entry point <strong>odata-comment</strong> will be reflected in one or more meeting minutes.</p>

<p>The linkage from the representation of received comment as noted in the public comment archive rooted at <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata-comment/">https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata-comment/</a> to the documentation of its specific processing inside meeting minutes SHOULD be provided through a publicly accessible URL of the meeting minutes. To ease the navigation for the reader this link MAY have a fractional part which is the derived ID as described in section [<a href="#pcnotation">3</a>]. For meeting minutes this fractional target is guaranteed to point to the relevant subsection of the minutes.</p>

<h2 id="ci_indicator">3.2 Linking from Issues to Public Comments</h2>

<p>If a comment results in an issue created in JIRA the subject of the issue should indicate this by appending the string literal <strong>(public comment $ceID)</strong> with $ceID being replaced with the commentEntryID as described in section [<a href="#pcnotation">3</a>] (cf. [<a href="#ci_sample">sample</a>] below).</p>

<p>It is also beneficial, if the description of the JIRA issue starts with text following the pattern:</p>

<pre><code>The public comment 
[$ceID](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata-comment/$yearMonth/msg$entryID.html) 
with title &quot;$subjectOrTitle&quot; indicates, ...
</code></pre>

<p>with: </p>

<ul>
<li>$ceID being replaced with the commentEntryID as described in section [<a href="#pcnotation">3</a>]</li>
<li>$yearMonth replaced with the matching Year-Month folder part of the URL path</li>
<li>$entryID replaced with the corresponding entry ID</li>
<li>$subjectOrTitle replaced with the subject of the mail or a title as suggested by the TC (eg. edit for readability, typos etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ci_sample">3.2.1 Sample for Comment Linkage Notation in Issues</h2>

<p>As a sample, the first comment received, resulted in issue <a href="https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-232">ODATA&#8211;232</a> with the summary:</p>

<p>&#8220;Enhance description of normalization procedures (public comment c201301e00001)&#8221; </p>

<p>and the description:</p>

<p>&#8220;The public comment <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata-comment/201301/msg00001.html">c201301e00001</a> with title &#8221;Query String parsing in URIs&#8220; indicates, that the description of normalization procedures in the ABNF Construction Rules can be enhanced.&#8221;.</p>
