#Notes on formal aspects common to OASIS OData TC's meeting minutes

Reference-ID: [formal-aspects-meeting-minutes-v1](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/KaviID/)
Version:	1.0-20130114 


##1. Review of [Action Items](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_items.php) (AI) and Progress

Action items are referenced by their local ID as generated by the Kavi-Tool upon creation. This ID consists of the constant string **AI#** and an automatically incremented number padded to the left with zeros and to 4 digits like eg. **AI#0123**.

The ownership of action items is noted `[owner: Given Family]` and as indicated by the [AI-List-Tool](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_items.php). Additionally the time stamp of retrieval is given in the preamble.

##1.1 Linking to AI progression sections in meeting minutes

The linkage to the documentation of an action items specific state progression inside meeting minutes SHOULD be provided through a publicly accessible URL of the meeting minutes. To ease the navigation for the reader this link MAY have a fractional part which is the **lowercased** action items ID where the **'#'sign has of course been stripped**. For meeting minutes this fractional target is guaranteed to point to the relevant subsection of the minutes.

As an example, for linking the action item **AI#0005** to its state progression (from '**Ongoing** (Note: Due 2013–01–10)' to '**Ongoing** (Note: Due 2013–01–31)') during meeting#20 the specific public URL is (fractional part='ai0005'):

##2 Review of [Issues List](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&pid=10103&sorter/field=issuekey&sorter/order=ASC) (IL) and Progress

Issues are referenced by their local ID as generated by JIRA upon creation. This ID consists of the constant string **ODATA-** and an automatically incremented number like eg. **ODATA-123**.
 
###2.1 Notation of Issue State Progressions during Meetings

We minute an issue state progression as an ordered triple consisting of:

1. The initial issue summary (including its status **before** the meeting)
2. Discussion content and decisions i.e. **formally required motion text** potentially _overriding a proposed solution (of the issue's instance in JIRA)_ at the time of the meeting.
3. The resulting issue summary (including its updated status _plus eventual modifications linking to the motion text_  **after** the meeting)

The rationale behind this is: a) to **document the initial status** - _which may well deviate from the (tentative) status set inside the instance in JIRA at that time_, b) to **optimize the transfer of changes resulting from the discussion back into the issue's instance inside JIRA** (if dictated by the accepted motion) and last but not least c) to **ease the lookup** for the reader.

The value of the main status is one (_and only one_) from the set (**New**, **Open**, **Deferred**, **Proposed**, **Resolved**, **Applied** or **Closed**) as documented in "[Best Practices for Issue Handling](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47021/Best%20Practices%20for%20Issue%20Handling%20v9.docx)", where the states and transitions are further explained as they have been adopted by the TC.

A step by step recipe on how to apply these resolutions to new revisions of work products is given in "[How to Apply Resolved Issues](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47018/How%20to%20Apply%20Resolved%20Issues.docx)" and shall assist the editors performing the many formally necessary (but often _purely mechanical_) steps needing attention along the way.

###2.2 Lifecycle of 'Mainstream' Issues

For the purpose of this section any issue that results in an implemented change will be considered a 'mainstream' issue. The typical lifecycle of such an issue and with focus on the relation between actions, status and documentation in meeting minutes may be illustrated as:
 
1. Created as **New** by Reporter -> **New** [+ Comments]
2. [optional as step 2] The **Proposed** flag can be set during **New** discussions to indicate that the issues' proposal is ready for resolution. _If and only if this is the case, then the steps labelled 3 and 4 may be skipped. In all other cases the step labelled 4 will be mandatory_.
3. Accepted as **Open** by TC -> **Open** [+ Discussions [+ Motion [+ Amendment] ] ]
4. [optional as step 4, but mandatory as status] The **Proposed** flag can be set during **Open** discussions to indicate that a proposal is ready for resolution. _Only ready to implemented proposals will be resolved by the TC_.
5. **Resolved** as Proposed by TC -> **Resolved**
6. Implementation during work phase visible to the editor.
7. Signalled as **Applied** by Editor -> **Applied** [+ Discussions [+ Motion [+ Amendment] ] ] 
8. **Closed** as Applied by TC -> **Closed**

The relation of incoming and outgoind issues states is further listed and explained in the following subsection. Any remaining details on available issue states and transitions may be found in "[Best Practices for Issue Handling](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47021/Best%20Practices%20for%20Issue%20Handling%20v9.docx)".

####2.2.1 Relation of Incoming and Outgoing Issue States

The issues that are put on a TC meeting agenda MUST have one of the three following  incoming states: 

1. **New+Proposed** 
* **Open+Proposed** 
* **Applied** 

For each of those incoming issue states, the corresponding possible outgoing states - amended with explanations (_noted in parentheses_) - are:

1. Incoming state: **New+Proposed** implies the possible outgoing states: 
    1. **New+Proposed** (_TC did not act on this_), 
    * **Open+Proposed** (_TC agreed to open but has not resolved yet_), 
    * **New** (_TC removed the issue from Proposed since the proposal was not complete_), 
    * **Open** (_TC accepted the issue but  removed the issue from Proposed since the proposal was not complete_), 
    * **Resolved** (_successfully resolved_), 
    * **Closed** (_TC closed issue with no further action_).
2. Incoming state: **Open+Proposed** implies the possible outgoing states: 
    1. **Open+Proposed** (_TC did not act on this_), 
    * **Open** (_TC accepted the issue but  removed the issue from Proposed since the proposal was not complete_), 
    * **Resolved** (_successfully resolved_), 
    * **Closed** (_TC closed issue with no further action_).
3. Incoming state: **Applied** implies the possible outgoing states: 
    1. **Resolved** (_if the TC disagrees with the application of the resolution_), 
    * **Closed** (_TC agrees with the application of the resolution_).
 
 
##2.3 Linking from JIRA issues to state progression sections in meeting minutes

The linkage from the representation of an issue as noted in JIRA to the documentation of its specific state progression inside meeting minutes SHOULD be provided through a publicly accessible URL of the meeting minutes. To ease the navigation for the reader this link MAY have a fractional part which is the **lowercased** issues ID. For meeting minutes this fractional target is guaranteed to point to the relevant subsection of the minutes.

As an example, for linking the issue **ODATA-13** to its state progression (from **New** to **New+Proposed**) during meeting#20 the specific public URL is (fractional part='odata-13'):

[https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47861/odata-meeting-20_on-20130110-minutes.html#odata-13](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/47861/odata-meeting-20_on-20130110-minutes.html#odata-13)

The corresponding private URL (only visible to TC members) would be:

[https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47861/latest/odata-meeting-20_on-20130110-minutes.html#odata-13](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/download.php/47861/latest/odata-meeting-20_on-20130110-minutes.html#odata-13)  

As we tend to keep the filenames persistent, one can usually build the public from the private URL by

1. replacing 'apps/org/workgroup/odata/' with 'committees/' and
* removing 'latest/'

Thereby we maximize the public navigation experience throughout our documentation.
