1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

The ordering of the members of any JSON object defined in this
document MUST be considered irrelevant, as specified by [RFC4627].

The ordering of the elements of any JSON array defined in this
document MUST at least follow a stable ordering unless the specific
object's type it is a member of defines an absolute ordering, which
then takes precedence.

Some examples use the combination of a JavaScript single line comment
(//) followed by an ellipsis (...) as placeholder notation for
content deemed irrelevant by the authors and at that point.  These
placeholders must of course be deleted or otherwise replaced, before
attempting to validate the corresponding JSON code example.

.ti 0
1.2.  Example

A JSON OData object:
.bp
.nf

{
    "d": {
    // ...
    }
}
.fi


Note that unquoted whitespace is not significant in JSON.  Whitespace
is used in the examples inside this document to help illustrate the
data structures, but is not required.
