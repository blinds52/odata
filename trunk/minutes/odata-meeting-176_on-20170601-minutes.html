<h4>5.1.1 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-1075" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-1075</a> - Introduce subsetof operator for checking whether a collection is a subset or equal to another collection</h4>
<p>Mike: In reviewing the application, three questions came up: </p>
<pre>
1) is [1,1,2] subsetof [1,2] ? (do elements of the left operand have to occur at least as many times in the right operand) 

For ordered collections: 
2) is [3,1] subsetof [4,1,3]? (does order matter) 
3) is [4,3] subsetof [4,1,3]? (can sequence have gaps) 

For unordered collections both #2 and #3 should be true
</pre>
<p>Hubert and Mike: Tendency for items in right operand having to occur at least as many times as in left operand, so 1) would be false</p>
<p>Hubert: Tendency for ordering should not matter, introduce a separate operator for "subsequence preserving order"</p>
<p>Mike: Also need to define behavior if one is unordered and one is not ordered.</p>
<p>Mike: Option: subsetof is always unordered. a "contains" operator could apply only to ordered collections to take into account ordering.</p>
<p>Mike: What about null values?</p>
<p>Mike: null value is a value like any other value; you have to have at least as many null values in the right operand as the left</p>
<p>Mike: Proposal: define subsetof always to require that each element of the left operand occur at least as many times in the right operand, and that order does not matter. If we have someone asking for an operator that requires preservation of order with ordered collections we can add one at that time.</p>
<p>Mike: General question: when do we use functions and when do we use operators?</p>
<p>Mike: Functions are extensible. Operators have to be defined by TC.</p>
<p>Ralf: should we rename to "subCollectionOf" so it doesn't imply operands are sets. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence</a></p>
<p>Mike: subSequence could be used for the ordered comparison.
<p>Mike: For subsequence (as defined in Wikipedia) [4,3] would be a subsequence of [4,1,3].
<p>Mike: Wikipedia defines a subset operator for "multisets":</p>
<p>Ralf: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset</a> - essentially what our unordered collections are</p>
<p>Mike: The set indicator function of a subset is smaller than or equal to that of the superset</p>
<pre>
A  B   x , 1 A ( x )  1 B ( x ) . {\displaystyle A\subseteq B\Leftrightarrow \forall x,\,\mathbf {1} _{A}(x)\leq \mathbf {1} _{B}(x).}
</pre>
<p>Hubert: [4,1,5] contains [1,5]</p>
<p>Ralf:: [4,1,5] contains [4,5] eq false</p>
<p>Hubert: [4,5] sequenceof [4,1,5] eq true</p>
<p>Hubert: [4,5] subsequenceof [4,1,5] eq true</p>
<p>Ralf: contains([4,1,5],[1,5]) --> true</p>
<p>Ralf: contains('abc','ab')</p>
<p>Ralf: contains(Firstname,'al')</p>
<p>Ralf: $filter=contains(Firstname,'al')</p>
<p>George: How is case covered?  'Al' vs 'al'</p>
<p>Hubert: Propose we, apart from contains, also overwrite the startswith, endswith, indexof and substring??? functions with versions that accept collections</p>
<p>Ralf: only for ordered collections</p>
<p>Ralf: Strings essentially are ordered collections of characters</p>
<p>Ralf: Need also subsequenceof and subsetof, either as functions or as operators</p>
<p>Mike: Summary:</p>
<pre>
From 2017-6-1 discussion:
1) elements of the left operand have to occur at least as many times in the right operand (sos [1,1,2] subsetof [1,2]  => false 
2) subsetof should never take order (or gaps) into account:
   i [3,1] subsetof [4,1,3] => true 
  ii [4,3] subsetof [4,1,3] => true
3) for ordered collections, a "subsequence" operator could take order into account. subsequence is defined by Wikipedia to ignore gaps:
   i [3,1] subsetof [4,1,3] => false 
  ii [4,3] subsetof [4,1,3] => true
4) for ordered collections, an operator that takes gaps into account is really a "contains":
   i [3,1] contains [4,1,3] => false 
  ii [4,3] contains [4,1,3] => false
5) for ordered collections we could also define startswith, endswith, and indexof.

Question: which should we add now (versus wait for scenarios for) and should we add as functions or as operators?
</pre>
<p>Hubert: ~/Products?$filter=contains(CustomersThatBoughtThisProduct,[MostFavoriteCustomer(),LeastFavoriteCustomer]) eq true</p>
<p>Hubert: ~/Products?$filter=contains(CustomersThatBoughtThisProduct,[{"@odata.id":"Customers('MostFavoriteCustomerID')"},{"@odata.id":"Customers('LeastFavoriteCustomerID')"}]) eq true</p>
<p>Mike: Updated Proposal</p>
<pre>
1) subsetOf always requires that each element of the left operand occur at least as many times in the right operand, and that order does not matter so:  
    subsetof([1,1,2],[1,2])  => false 
subsetof should never take order (or gaps) into account:
    subsetof([4,1,3],[3,1]) => true 
    subsetof([4,1,3],[4,3]) => true

2) for ordered collections, add a "subsequenceof" function that takes order into account and ignores gaps:
    subsequenceof([4,1,3], [3,1])  => false 
    subsequenceof([4,1,3],[4,3]) => true

3) add support for ordered collections to contains, startswith, endswith, indexof, and substring, that takes gaps into account.
</pre>
<p><b>Hubert</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-1075 as per the amended proposal.</p>
<p>Mike: updated:</p>
<pre>
Restrict "in" to mean just "member of" 
Add "subsetof" function:

1) subsetOf always requires that each element of the left operand occur at least as many times in the right operand, and that order does not matter so:  
    subsetof([1,2],[1,1,2])  => false 
subsetof should never take order (or gaps) into account:
    subsetof([4,1,3],[3,1]) => true 
    subsetof([4,1,3],[4,3]) => true

2) for ordered collections, add a "subsequenceof" function that takes order into account and ignores gaps:
    subsequenceof([4,1,3], [3,1])  => false 
    subsequenceof([4,1,3],[4,3]) => true

3) add support for ordered collections to contains (that takes gaps into account) as well as startswith, endswith, indexof, and substring.
</pre>
<p>Ralf: indexof('Alfred','lf') --> 1</p>
<p>Ralf: contains('Alfred','lf') --> true</p>
<p>Ralf: hassubset([0,1,2],[1,2]) --> true</p>
<p>Mike: alternate (clearer) naming:</p>
<pre>
Restrict "in" to mean just "member of" 
Add "hassubset" function:

1) hassubset always requires that each element of the right argument occurs at least as many times in the left argument, and that order does not matter so:  
    hassubset([1,2],[1,1,2])  => false 
hassubset should never take order (or gaps) into account:
    hassubset([4,1,3],[3,1]) => true 
    hassubset([4,1,3],[4,3]) => true

2) for ordered collections, add a "hassubsequence" function that takes order into account and ignores gaps:
    hassubsequence([4,1,3], [3,1])  => false 
    hassubsequence([4,1,3],[4,3]) => true

3) add support for ordered collections to contains (that takes gaps into account) as well as startswith, endswith, indexof, and substring.
