<h2>6. V4.01 Issues for V4.01_WD01 in New or Open state</h2>
<h3>6.1 Ripe for resolution</h3>

<h4>6.1.1 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-827" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-827</a> - introduce $compute query option</h4>

<p>Ralf: Add "$compute" query option allowing additional computed properties to be added to each instance. The syntax is similar to the compute() transformation in Data Aggregation, i.e. $compute=&lt;list of compute expressions>, but without the restriction to simple values: allowed compute expressions are any expressions valid in a $filter system query option on the input set. <br>
<br>
More formally: <br>
  compute = '$compute' EQ computeItem *( COMMA computeItem ) <br>
  computeItem = commonExpr RWS 'as' RWS computedProperty <br>
  computedProperty = odataIdentifier <br>
<br>
$compute is also allowed as query option nested within $expand to add computed dynamic properties to expanded entities. <br>
<br>
$compute is logically evaluated first, so the computed dynamic properties can be used in $expand, $filter, $orderby, and $select. <br>
<br>
Computed structural properties SHOULD be added to the default selection (in absence of $select), and are treated as other dynamic properties: <br>
- $select=* includes computed structural properties <br>
- $expand=* includes computed navigation properties or computed entities/collections of entities <br>
- appear in context URL same way as other (dynamic) properties <br>
<br>
GET ~Customers?$expand=Orders($compute=price*qty as totalprice;$select=name,price,qty,totalprice)<br></p>

<p>Ralf: Addition to proposal: when nested in $expand, the computed property name must only be unique within the type(s) of the expanded properties</p>
<p>Ralf: Computed properties in expanded entities can be addressed with path notation just as declared properties</p>
<p>Mike: Note: in this example, totalprice is available outside of the expand as Orders/totalprice, as in:<br>
GET ~Customers?$filter=Orders/totalprice gt 100&amp;$expand=Orders($compute=price*qty as totalprice;$select=name,price,qty,totalprice)<br>
</p>
<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we approve ODATA-827 as proposed. <b>Ramesh</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-827 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h4>6.1.2 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-933" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-933</a> - Allow using instance annotations in $filter</h4>

<p>Ralf: Clarification: use same rules as for dynamic properties if instance annotation is not defined for an entity</p>
<p>Ralf: Services MAY support this, not a MUST</p>
<p>Ralf: Example: numeric exception values</p>
<p>Ralf: GET Something?$filter=Age@numericValueException eq 'NaN'</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-933 is OPEN</p>
<p>Mark: have Capability annotation "CanFilterOnInstanceAnnotations"</p>
<p>Ralf: Consider this also for $select, would be more explicit than in an odata.include-annotations preference.</p>
<p>Mike: Perhaps wait until we have some usage scenarios before trying to figure out meaningful capabilities.</p>
<p>Mike: open separate issue for instance annotations in $select and $expand, limit this issue to $filter - Mike to create the new issue</p>
<p><b>Ralf</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-933 with the amended proposal: limited to $filter, purely optional feature that services MAY support. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-933 is resolved with the amended proposal</p>

<p>Mike has created <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-975" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-975</a> to keep track of instance annotations in $select and $expand</p>

<h4>6.1.3 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-953" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-953</a> - Consider deprecating structural casting</h4>

<p>Ralf: Structural casting is a MAY, so as long as we do not explicitly forbid structural casting we can remove it</p>
<p>Mike: Current Proposal: Clarify that structural casting MUST NOT be applied anywhere other than the explicit cast operator; i.e., it MUST NOT be applied when using cast segments nor evaluating isof.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-953 is OPEN</p>
<p>Mike: Since currently optional, revised proposal could be: Remove current language around structural casting.</p>
<p>Mike: I propose we resolve ODATA-953 by removing the current language around structural casting.</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-953 by removing the current language around structural casting. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-953 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h4>6.1.4 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-954" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-954</a> - Key-As-Segment for multi-part keys</h4>

<p>Ralf: Generalize the rules in ODATA-799 to allow key-as-segment notation also for multi-part keys. <br>
<br>
Example: an accounting document is identified by the company code, the year, and the (auto-incremented) document number: <br></p>
<pre>
    &lt;EntityType Name="AccountingDocument"> 
    &lt;Key> 
      &lt;PropertyRef Name="CompanyCode" /> 
      &lt;PropertyRef Name="Year" /> 
      &lt;PropertyRef Name="DocumentNumber" /> 
    &lt;/Key> 
    &lt;/EntityType> 
</pre>
<p>
Taking into account the order of &lt;PropertyRef> elements within the &lt;Key> element a single accounting document can be identified as <br>
<br>
  GET AccountingDocuments/SAP/2016/4329043280 <br>
<br>
An optional extension would be to treat the multi-part key as a "folder structure", i.e. <br>
<br>
  AccountingDocuments/SAP/2016 <br>
<br>
would identify the subset of accounting documents for a company and year, and <br>
<br>
  AccountingDocuments/SAP <br>
<br>
would identify the subset of accounting documents for a company. <br>
<br>
Services could optionally support this as a shorthand for <br>
<br>
   GET AccountingDocuments?$filter=CompanyCode eq 'SAP' and Year eq '2016' <br>
<br>
and <br>
<br>
   GET AccountingDocuments?$filter=CompanyCode eq 'SAP'<br></p>
<p>Mike: Could separate into two parts: first, support for multi-part key-as-segment and second as partial keys for both parens and key-as-segment</p>
<p>Ralf: Mike has created ODATA-976 Support partial keys</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-954 only for fully specified multi-part keys</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-954 is OPEN</p>
<p>Ralf: Generalize the rules in ODATA-799 to allow key-as-segment notation also for multi-part keys. <br>
<br>
Example: an accounting document is identified by the company code, the year, and the (auto-incremented) document number: <br></p>

<pre>
    &lt;EntityType Name="AccountingDocument"> 
    &lt;Key> 
      &lt;PropertyRef Name="CompanyCode" /> 
      &lt;PropertyRef Name="Year" /> 
      &lt;PropertyRef Name="DocumentNumber" /> 
    &lt;/Key> 
    &lt;/EntityType> 
</pre>
<p>
Taking into account the order of &lt;PropertyRef> elements within the &lt;Key> element a single accounting document can be identified as <br>
<br>
  GET AccountingDocuments/SAP/2016/4329043280</p>

<p>Ralf: Discussion on ambiguity: same rules apply as defined in <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-799" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-799</a></p>
<p>Mike: For ODATA-954, if one segment is resolved as a partial key value then the subsequent segments should be resolved as any remaining key values.
<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-954 as proposed. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-954 is resolved with the amended proposal</p>
<p>Ralf: Side note: introduce filter segment <br>
GET Something/$filter(@f)/some.function()?@f=...<br></p>

<h4>6.1.5 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-963" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-963</a> - Make query options case insensitivite</h4>

<p>Ralf: $Filter=Something EQ 42 OR SubstringOf(...)</p>
<p>Mike: Updated title: Make query options, built-in functions, and built-in operators case insensitive</p>
<p>Mike: Updated proposal: 4.01 services must support case insensitive system query options. built-in functions, and built-in operators 
Interoperable 4.01 clients must continue to use the 4.0 defined casing.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-963 is open</p>

<p><b>Stefan</b>: I <b>move</b> to resolve ODATA-963 as proposed. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-963 is resolved as proposed</p>

<h4>6.1.6 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-836" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-836</a> - Allow applying actions to a filtered collection of entities</h4>

<p>Ralf: Either add a path segment that takes a boolean expression, optionally deferred to a parameter alias, or allow POST in combination with $apply <br>
<br>
POST Products/$filter(Age gt 3)/Special.Discount <br>
POST Products/$filter(@f)/Special.Discount?@f=Age gt 3 <br>
<br>
POST Products?$apply=filter(Age gt 3)/Special.Discount <br>
<br>
Consider adding path equivalents of other query options: <br>
<br>
POST /Orders/$filter(@f)/$top(5)/Ship?@f=Details/ShippingDate lt now()<br></p>
<p>Mark: I don't have a use case right now.</p>
<p>Mike: The use of $apply from aggregation extension seems consistent and cleaner than trying to put something in the path.  As we have no urgent need, I would propose we postpone this to a future release as a proposal for how to address this if the need arises.</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we defer ODATA-836 until such a time as we have use cases requiring support for actions/functions on filtered sets, and then consider in favor of using $apply. <b>Stefan</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Ralf: ODATA-836 is deferred</p>
<p>Ralf: I've created https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-977 for the $apply case</p>

<h4>6.1.7 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-854" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-854</a> - Consider use of OPTIONS for discovering formats, other capabilities and features</h4>

<p>Ralf: Postpone until we have a proposal on the response format</p>

<h4>6.1.8 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-900" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ODATA-900</a> - Cross-service naviation and service versioning</h4>

<p>Ralf: Assume Orders and Customers are in different services and have cross-service navigation properties to each other:<br>
  GET Customers('ALFKI')/Orders<br>
  GET Orders(4711)/Customer<br>
<br>
Now a new version v2 of the Customer service is published. <br>
<br>
Ideally the Order service now automatically navigates to the new (latest) Customer service without requiring a new version of the Order service, and in addition allows navigation to the old version:<br>
  GET Orders(4711)/Customer -> navigates to Customer v2<br>
  GET Orders(4711)/Customer;v1 -> navigates to Customer v1<br></p>
<p>Ralf: Postponed to V4.02</p>

<h3>7. Next meetings</h3>

<h4>7.1 Next Meeting Thursday September 15, 2016 during 6-10am PDT</h4>
<p>Mike and Stefan favor 6am PDT and a longer meeting</p> 
<p>Agreed</p>

<h3>8. AOB and wrap up</h3>
<p>No other business.</p>

<p>Meeting adjourned by chair.</p>
