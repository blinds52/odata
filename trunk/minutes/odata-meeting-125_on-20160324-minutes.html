<h2>5. V4.01 issues - Issues for V4.01_WD01 in New or Open state</h2>
<h3>5.1 Set Operations</h3>

<h4>5.1.1 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-922" target="_blank">ODATA-922</a> - Support DELETE/PUT to $ref of a collection-valued nav prop to remove/replace all links</h4>
<p>Ram: ODATA-922 is OPEN, no objections</p>
<p>Mike: For containment, the specified links would have to already be in the collection; any links not in the collection would be removed (and, because it's containment, deleted).</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-922 as proposed. <b>Ramesh</b> seconds.</p>
<p>Motion passes, no objections. ODATA-922 is RESOLVED as proposed.</p>

<h4>5.1.2 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-924" target="_blank">ODATA-924</a> - Define semantics for PUT against a single entity with nested content</h4>

<p>Ram: ODATA-924 is OPEN, no objections</p>
<p>Mike: Discussion: Semantics should align with POST;<br>
1) You can include references (only) to existing entities (no content)<br>
2) The end result of the PUT is that the existing (references) and new (entities) are the full set of entities related according to that relationship.</p>

<p>Mike: Define that, when you do a PUT,<br>
1) You can include new entities and references to existing entities, but not content for existing entities<br>
2) The end result of the PUT is that the existing (references) and new (entities) are the full set of entities related according to that relationship.</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-924 as proposed. <b>Mark</b> seconds.</p>
<p>No objections, issue resolved as proposed. ODATA-924 is RESOLVED as proposed.</p>

<p id="s_5_1_2">Ram: Back from ODATA-927 (cf. <a href="#s_5_1_3">section 5.1.3</a> below)</p>

<p>Ram: No objection to opening the discussion on the proposal for ODATA-924.</p>
<p>Ram: The intention is to revise the previous resolution.</p>
<p>Mike: Revised proposal to align with PATCH (as per ODATA-876)</p>
<p>Mike: Define that, when you do a PUT,<br>
1) You can include new entities, existing entities, and references to existing entities<br>
2) Existing entities are updated using PUT semantics<br>
a) entities to be updated must have either @odata.id or key fields, otherwise interpreted as an insert<br>
3) The end result of the PUT is that the specified entities and entity references are the full set of entities related according to that relationship.</p>

<p>Ralf: From 11.4.3: Key and other non-updatable properties, as well as dependent properties that are not tied to key properties of the principal entity, can be omitted from the request. If the request contains a value for one of these properties, the service MUST ignore that value when applying the update.</p>

<p>Mike: Revised proposal for ODATA-924, to align with previously approved ODATA-876:<br>
Align Semantics of PUT with PATCH, as specified in ODATA-876, by specifying that, when you do a PUT,<br>
1) You can include new nested entities, existing entities, and references to existing entities<br>
2) Existing entities are updated using PUT semantics<br>
a) entities to be updated must have either @odata.id or key fields, otherwise interpreted as an insert<br>
b) if @odata.id and key fields both exist but don't match, then request is invalid<br>
3) The end result of the PUT is that the specified entities and entity references are the full set of entities related according to that relationship.</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> to revise the previously approved resolution to ODATA-924 as described in the revised proposal. <b>Matt</b> seconds.</p>
<p>No objections, the motion passes with unanimous support. ODATA-924 is RESOLVED as proposed.</p>


<h4>5.1.3 <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-927" target="_blank">ODATA-927</a> - Explicitly disallow existing nested items in Deep Insert</h4>

<p>Mike: New related issue: ODATA-927</p>
<p>Ram: ODATA-927 is now OPEN, no objections. Related issue: (<a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-876" target="_blank">ODATA-876</a> - Allow services to return contained entities inline for delta responses).</p>
<p>Matt: See also for reference: <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/ODATA-873" target="_blank">ODATA-873</a> - Define a default order for deep inserted entities in responses</p>

<p>Mike Pizzo: Copied proposal from PUT:</p>
<p>Mike: Clarify that, when doing a POST:<br>
1) You can include new entities and references to existing entities, but not content for existing entities<br>
2) The end result of the POST is that the existing (references) and new (entities) are the full set of entities related according to that relationship.<br></p>


<p>Mike (w.r.t. ODATA-927): Clarify that, when doing a POST:<br>
1) You can include new entities and references to existing entities, but not content for existing entities<br>
2) The end result of the POST is that the existing (references) and new (entities) are the full set of entities related according to that relationship.</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>: I <b>move</b> we resolve ODATA-927 as proposed. <b>Matt</b> seconds.</p>
<p>No objections. ODATA-927 is RESOLVED as proposed.</p>
