####4.3.1 [AI#0018](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_item.php?action_item_id=3483)

AI#0018
: "Prepare Working Draft 01 (WD01) version of OData Extension for Temporal Data" [owner: Andrew Eisenberg] is **Ongoing**

Discussion:

* Hubert intends to take some of the task from the actions previously assigned to Andrew
* Ram asks for some date?
* Hubert is still planning to come up with a date in the next weeks
* Ram suggests to put the date end of June (end of CSD02 review) as a first milestone
* Hubert suggests to first come up with a seed document incorporating the ideas from Zurich and then plan further
* Mike intends to help
* Stefan also offers help in getting started with the documents
* Hubert asks to take owership of action item AI#0018

AI#0018
: "Prepare Working Draft 01 (WD01) version of OData Extension for Temporal Data" [owner: Hubert Heijkers] is **Ongoing**

####4.3.2 [AI#0019](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_item.php?action_item_id=3484)

AI#0019
: "Prepare Working Draft 01 (WD01) version of OData Extension for XML Data" [owner: Andrew Eisenberg] is **Ongoing**

Discussion:

* Susan tries to help push the xml extension (as vocabulary mainly)
* Stefan will support in writing and pushing
* Ralf and Mike will assist by commenting but have no time to drive it
* ALL: Idea is to focus on vocabulary as xml extension to be able to push this in parallel to the other work product
* Stefan: if standards or non-standards track should be decided from the start, as a non-normative document will never just change into a normative, it has to start from zero again.
* Mike suggests that we produce a vocabulary as xml extension as a TC but through the non-normative track
* Stefan also thinks this is a good goal, but likes to think about it a bit more
* Susan and Stefan will work together to decide how both the OData Extension for XML and JSON Data should be produced and in the longer term where the ownership will be placed for those two extensions
* The first target date (due date of the action) would be next face to face (end of meeting)
