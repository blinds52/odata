These added properties are similar to dynamic properties that may be returned from an open type, but we do not want to require that a type be open in order to allow the addition of custom aggregations - defining a type as open tells the client there may be additional properties in the payload and implies that the client can persist dynamic properties as part of instances of that entity type. We do not need to tell the client there may be additional properties &#8211; they are the one that asked for the additional properties, and we don&#8217;t want to require that the service support persisting dynamic properties in order to support adding custom aggregation.</li><li>Mike: <strong>Action</strong>: We need to make sure the protocol is clear that (libraries) should be prepared to handle additional (dynamic) properties in the payload not defined in the type, either because the type is marked as open or because the client has requested additional properties in the response.</li></ul><p><em>(A short break)</em></p><p>Discussion (continued):</p><p>Context &#8220;3.1.2.2.5 The Standard Aggregation Function distinctCount&#8221;:</p><ul><li>Stefan: Why is it called <code>distinctCount</code> and not <code>countDistinct</code></li><li>Mike: Explains from SQL point of view <code>countDistinct</code> is better matching the intended <code>count distinct</code>at least in this case.</li><li>Hubert: States it should be more correct to name the term that way</li><li>All: <strong>Decision</strong>: Use <code>countDistinct</code> instead of <code>distinctCount</code> as it is better English.</li></ul><p>Context &#8220;3.2 $rollup&#8221;:</p><ul><li>Ralf: <strong>Request for Input from members</strong>: ￼How does $rollup work together with $top, $skip, and $inlinecount? Will it only take the finest level of ￼granularity into account and add subtotals for a group when a group boundary is part of that chunk? Assumption: client-driven paging is for “painting a screen”. For cross-tab reports this depends on the page layout (axis arrangement) chosen by the client, so we could forbid $top, $skip and $inlinecount in conjunction with $rollup and force the client to add filters to the request, e.g. Country eq ‘USA’. The client can get the list of values for constructing these filters with a “distinct” request up-front.</li></ul><p>Context &#8220;3.4 Processing Sequence&#8221;:</p><ul><li>Ralf: <strong>Action</strong>: Define how rollup rows are ordered and where they are placed in the response (interspersed or at the end). Interspersed and ordered with the base result entities seems to be least surprising and most consistent.</li><li>Ralf: <strong>Proposal</strong>: Ordering of rollup rows within detail rows is up to the service if no $orderby is given, otherwise at the position determined by $orderby. Servers may support $top and $skip. If so, they treat rollup rows and detail rows identically. So $rollup is done after $filter and before $inlinecount.</li><li>Anila: What is the behavior of $skip and $top after $skiptoken (as defined in the order of evaluation)?</li><li>All: Discussion of use cases and detaileld consequences of usage in event of $skiptoken</li><li>Mike: Sees this as the difference between client vs. server driven paging.</li><li>Mike opened a JIRA issue: <a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-163">Clarify, in OData Protocol, that $skip and $top are not allowed to be appended to a next link</a> since it does not seem useful, and in fact seems a bad idea, for the client to attempt to apply $skip and $top to a next link.</li></ul><p>Further on (More examples):</p><ul><li>Susan: Asks on meaning of the three $rollup variants.</li><li>Hubert explains.</li><li>Stefan: Besides $rollup=(&#8230;) unfiltered will we see also unexpanded, unskipped &#8230; ?</li><li>Stefan explains, that if more commands would be un&#8216;&#8230;&#8216;ed, this would be hard for client parsers to keep mappings which un&#8217;&#8230;&#8216;ed belongs to which &#8217;&#8230;&#8217;</li><li>Hubert: Explaines, that unfiltered remains a singleton.</li></ul><p>Further on (Now enter $rollup&quot;):</p><ul><li>Topic: Samples like <code>... $rollup=(Customer/Country-sum-Customer/Name), (Time/Year-average-Time/Month)</code></li><li>Hubert explains the need for inserting the wanted aggregation between all pairs in a $rollup if default aggregation has been overwridden.</li><li>Mike asks for a clear rule, otherwise leave this server dependent and suggests opening a JIRA issue on this but start with one variant for now.</li><li>All: <strong>Decision</strong>: For the base analytics document, we will not propose custom aggregations for rollups, and leave it up to the service to define what aggregation is meaningful for the rollups. We will open a separate JIRA ticket to consider proposal of specific syntax and rules around specifying custom aggregation functions for rollups.</li><li>Mike opened the JIRA issue: <a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-164">Consider syntax and rules around client specifying custom aggregation functions for rollups</a> saying: <code>For the base analytics document, we did not propose custom aggregations for rollups, and left it up to the service to define what aggregation is meaningful for the rollups.

You are not supposed to construct the delta link yourself short of adding the query options discussed right now.</li><li>Matt argues, that using $inlinecount already means you are getting some changes. $count is simply a question of how many changes there are.</li><li>Hubert explains that this is correct but $count is not a query option, but you could get the $inlinecount while specifying $top=0. That would presumably giving you just the inline count I&#8217;d imagine</li><li>Mike updates the slide 7 accordingly, now saying, that <ul><li>Query options that are not applicable to deltas <ul><li>$orderby (thus removed $count, $value)</li></ul></li><li>Note: can&#8217;t use $count and $value because they are query segments.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>(short fifteen minutes break)</em></p><p>In closing Mike lists the open issues:</p><ul><li>How do we treat $expand in a delta query?</li><li>Is deleted reason optional?
