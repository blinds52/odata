### 5.1 Status of Public Review of OData Extension for Data Aggregation Committee Specification Draft 01

[OData Extension for Data Aggregation Committee Specification Draft 01 successfully completed a 30-day public review on Sept 19, 2013](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata/201308/msg00090.html). There were no comments arising from that public review.
All issues filed so far on this spec have been addressed.

### 5.2 Pending issues?

Are there more issues any one plans to file on the specification? If so, by when?

### 5.3 Discussion

Lets discuss our plans and timeline for further advancing this specification towards Committee Specification.

Discussion:

* Mike walks us through the motivation for the changes applied to the current document draft revision and notes, that these are related to [ODATA-574](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-574).
* Ralf walks us through the current draft document revision of [OData Extension for Data Aggregation Version 4.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/51703/odata-data-aggregation-ext-v4.0-wd02-2013-12-12.docx) which is shared during the meeting and where these changes have been applied.
* All agree with the changes applied so far (for the relevant motion on ODATA-574 please cf. [6.1.1][odata-574])

Next steps and member time slots available:

* Ram asks for availability to meet 2013-DEC-19
* Diane, Gerald, Hubert, John, Martin, Matt, Mike, Ralf, Ram, Ron, and Ted will be available.
* Ken will be available for part of the time
* Stefan will be (presumably) not available as he will be on holiday
* Mike suggests, that next week there will be no regular meeting, but the next revision will be posted regardless and Mike and Ralf will walk through the document changes if there is enough interest.
* Ram suggests to meet on an informal basis on next thursday
* Mike sees this in line with the editors timeline expectations, as the plan is to finish next week and give the members time until january 6th to review and subsequently have voting at the January 9th meeting
* Susan suggests, that it would be nice if there is an intro to the revised document next week (like the one provided by Mike today) - in addition to a walkthrough
* Ram will schedule a meeting for next week
* Mike suggests to discuss and presumable resolve ODATA-574 based on todays walk through
* All agree (for the relevant motion on ODATA-574 please cf. [6.1.1][odata-574]).
