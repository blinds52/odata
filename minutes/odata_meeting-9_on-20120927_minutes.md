##5. Next face to face meeting##

>Context: At the previous meeting we confirmed that we will have a 2-day F2F meeting hosted by IBM at Littleton, MA during Nov 8-9, 2012. The exact address of the meeting location will be available soon. A teleconferencing facility will be available for remote attendees. Any questions?.

Discussion:

* Gerald asks, if the remote audience may share slides and such
* Ram states, that as last time voice and chat will be shared, and presentation material shall be prepared before the meeting, so the remote audience may navigate in parallel with the presented live materila via the uploaded presentation files
* Mike asks which channels are offered
* Ram details, that the same dial-in numbers will allow following the remote participants

In concluding, Ram gently reminds all members to take notice and plan for the event based on the information provided by Barabara in the daily event pages for [Thursday (i.e. 2012-11-08)](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/event.php?event_id=33706) and [Friday (i.e. 2012-11-09)](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/event.php?event_id=33707) respectively.

##6 Organization of Work Products##

###6.1 Discussion of [Proposal](http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata/201209/msg00197.html)

>[Proposal](http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata/201209/msg00197.html) for structure of Work Products:

1. Multi-part OData Core
	1. Part 1: Core protocol document (includes Batch processing "content" and the normative reference to ABNF [_minus URL minus JSON rules_] text document _if and only if file is not empty after "refactoring"_)
	2. Part 2: URL conventions document (_includes normative reference to URL conventions ABNF text document_)
	3.	Part 3: CSDL document (includes non-normative references to CSDL schema text documents _and hopefully hints, why this is not normative?_)
2. Standalone OData Atom format (_is there also a schema, which might be factored out to aid implementers in validating?_)
3. Standalone OData JSON format (_includes normative references to ABNF JSON format text document_)

Mike:
>I **move** to accept the proposed organization of the OData TC Documents. **Stefan seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. **Motion passes**.

The **Proposal is approved**.

###7.3 Issues in New and Proposed state###

General discussion on processing procedure during meetings (surfaced during processing of issue ODATA-114 in section 7.3.2):

* Shishir asks if it is possible that when "any" issue is being discussed at a minimum a) what the issue is b) why it is important is prefaced by the proponent? 
* Shishir motivates, that as an attendee who is not intensly plugged into oData but would like to keep in touch, he finds the meetings are more like an auction devoid of any technical content.
* Andrew mentions, that we have a lot of issues being resolved on work level offline in non controversial mode, thus in the meeting only little reference is needed to resolve by motion
* Andrew further explains, that the large backlog of issues is one fact and that he appreciates the compromise of offline work in combination with  individual resolution during meetings and in short time as another (supportive) fact
* Ram suggests, that please members that need more clarity w.r.t. issues to ask
* John states, that there is a responsibility to prepare for the meetings by reviewing the documents before the meeting. You have the right to defer, postpone, send back for more info.
* Martin supports Johns statement
* Stefan also supports Johns statement and suggests in conclusion to follow Rams and Johns proposal and hints in combination with the chat as elementary context provider
* Mike suggests to summarize in a minute per issue the essence of it
* Shishir would see this as an advantage

**No further discussion**. **No objections**.

####7.3.1 [ODATA-98](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-98)####

: "DateTime[Offset]: allow 24:00[:00] in time part" [component: OData CSDL] is **new**. 

Mike:
>I **move** to not allow 24:00[:00] in the time part as it is not supported in many systems, languages, and back-ends, including HTTP time formats. **Stefan seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Mikes states that many languages, frameworks, and storage systems don't support 24:00 and thus would possibly break, if 24:00 is allowed.

>I **move** to defer discussion to next meeting. **Stefan seconds**.
