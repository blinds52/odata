<h4>5.2 ODATA-728 "A recursive hierarchy annotation may also contain a navigation property to the parent node"</h4>

<p>Ralf:
<br>
<br>NodeProperty: ID
<br>ParentNodeProperty: Manager/ID
<br>ParentNavigationProperty: Manager
</p>

<p>Hubert: Objection: ParentNodeProperty must not be nullable
<br>ParentNavigationProperty must not be nullable, ParentNodeProperty is removed</p>
<p>Hubert: I move to resolve ODATA-728 with the following amendments; Remove the term property "ParentNodeProperty" and making the ParentNavigationProperty required by change the Nullable property to false. Stefan seconds.</p>

<h4>5.7 ODATA-702 "Define the behaviour of system query option $count and path segment /$count in combination with $apply"</h4>

<p>Ralf:
<br>
<br>$apply on resource paths ending in /$count acts on the set "preceding" the /$count, the result is the plain-text number of items in the result of $apply, similar to the combination of /$count and $filter 
<br>
<br>$count system query option is executed after $apply, @odata.count contains the number of items in the result of $apply
</p>
<p>ODATA-702 is OPEN</p>
<p>Hubert: I move to resolve ODATA-702 as proposed. Stefan seconds.</p>

<pre>
&lt;Annotations Target="SalesModel.Product"&gt; 
    &lt;Annotation Term="Aggregation.LeveledHierarchy"

     &lt;Record&gt; 
      &lt;PropertyValue Property="Levels"&gt; 
        &lt;Collection&gt; 
          &lt;String&gt;Category/Name&lt;/String>

     &lt;/Record&gt;

</pre>
</p>
<p>Hubert: I move to resolve ODATA-701 as proposed. Gerald seconds.</p>

<h4>5.9 ODATA-662 "Allow usage of $apply as "Expand Option" in $expand"</h4>

<p>Martin: We haven't specified the usage of $apply as "Expand Option" in $expand. 
There are good use cases for $apply as an option of $expand (and it combines very well): 
<br>
<br>GET Products?$expand=Sales($apply=aggregate(Amount with sum as Total))
<br>
<br>Returns all products, and the Sales navigation property value is a one-element array with the Total
Means: per Product in top-level result inline result of
</p>
<p>Mike: does the syntax of $apply prevent nesting it in $expand?</p>
<p>Martin: no, no semicolons used in $apply syntax</p>
<p>Mike: seems like a pretty core thing</p>

<p>Mike: I move to resolve ODATA-662 as proposed. Gerald seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-662 is resolved as proposed</p>

<p>ODATA-588 is OPEN</p>
<p>Stefan: I move to resolve ODATA-588 as proposed. Gerald seconds.</p>
<p>ODATA-588 is resolved as proposed</p>


<h3>6. Next meeting</h3>

<p>Thursday May 21, 2015 during 8-10am PDT / 17:00-19:00 CEST ?</p>
<p>Agreed</p>


<h3>7. AOB and wrap up</h3>

<p>Mike: Have accumulated several issues that go beyond errata. How about starting on V4.1 to address these issues?</p>
<p>Mike: Related topic: People planning a REST API don't perceive OData as approrpiate. Spec is rather long. Also name seems to limit it to "database access". 
Not clear that entry barrier (minimal conformance) is pretty easy.</p>
<p>Mike: Publish a "REST API Profile" - short description of how to start and use parts of OData to solve common REST API problems</p>
<p>Names suggested: I-REST, O-REST, ...</p> 
<p>Mark: hear the same sort of comments. Complaints from client side that it looks too complex.</p>
<p>Mike: looking at JSON or JSON Schema first impression is just one or two pages of text with examples, plus pointer to full spec</p>
<p>Mike: We should try to give the same first impression of simplicity</p>
<p>Mike will put together a proposal of how this could look like</p>
<p>Stefan: XML for $metadata also adds to the entry barrier. Using JSON (Schema) for CSDL would lower that barrier</p>
<p>Mike: need to check whether adding a JSON $metadata requires the TC to adjust its charter</p>
<p>Need to define the scope of our work for the next 12-18 months and have our charter reflect that:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON for $metadata</li>
<li>V4.1 as a compatible protocol version with version negotiation</li>
<li>I-REST / ... profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Martin: make sure that the things we want to put into V4.1 doesn't make it too hard for V4.0 implementations to also support V4.1</p>
<p>Mike: need high degree of interop between 4.1 and 4.0, no substantive changes</p>
<p>Ralf: Check existing issues "parked" on V4.1 whether they can be added "non-breaking"</p>
<p>All: Definitely: if client requests MaxVersion 4.0 it just gets plain 4.0</p>
<p>Stefan: non-breaking, compelling changes</p>
<p>Mike: identify what's important to add</p>
<p>Ralf: Have both complete V4.1 spec plus a "delta to V4.0" document describing only the changes</p>
<p>Stefan: definitely worth it</p>
<p>Martin: talk about this in two weeks, notify Hubert of this decision</p>
<p>Ralf will place that on the agend of next meeting.</p>
