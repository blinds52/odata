<h3>5. Submitting OData v3 and OData JSON Format v4 to ISO/IEC JTC 1 </h3>
<h4>5.1 Status of errata publication</h4>

<p>Ralf presents status of submission / publication and especially highlights troubles with bookmarks/references in word between documents in two documents of the work products produced ... effect unreadable text in approx. twenty places ... Problem not in freshly opened word (source) documents but when producing PDF from them through auto-refresh of the layout machinery in word.</p>

<p>Mike emphasizes, that this only a publishing effect no technical ODATA change whatsoever. So it is annoying if we do not resubmit another errata we would have to deal with documents intermixed with "fieldcodes" in the bookmark text.</p>

<p>Ram will speak with TC Admin how to best address this issue.</p>

<h4>5.2 Public interoperability evidence</h4>
<p>... adding to list of meeting #81:</p>
