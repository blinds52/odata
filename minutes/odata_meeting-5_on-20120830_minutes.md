####4.1.1 [AI#0021](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_item.php?action_item_id=3486)####

AI#0021
: "Chairs to discuss with and provide tools to editors to help with specification versioning" [owner: Ram Jeyaraman] is **Closed** as __completed__ with no objections. 

###4.2 Action items NOT due by 2012-08-30 but MAY be ready for closure###

####4.2.1 [AI#0022](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_item.php?action_item_id=3512)####

AI#0022
: "Investigate with the TC administration how to manage the isolated ABNF Grammar artifact in the standardizing process" [owner: Ram Jeyaraman] is **Open** due to amendment (see below). 


Michael: 
>I **move** that the ABNF document remain in a text document, referenced as normative related document from the OData Core Protocol Specification. **Ralf seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Michael suggests to get rid of the wrapper word document and solely publish the normative artifact ABNF Grammar as text file.
* Stefan can live with any balance as long as no damage is done to normative text formats and as extra achievments are conserved that would have to go into a container like the requested word format of the workproduct
* Ralf suggests to set the then required canonical name for this text format ABNF Grammar File

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

Action remains open, Ralf will suggest name until next meeting.

##5. Next face to face meeting##

###5.1 Discussion of results from [Electronic ballot](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/ballot.php?id=2278)###

>Context: The completed [e-ballot](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/ballot.php?id=2278) on possible dates for the next F2F and discussion in meeting#4 

The week of Nov 5-9, 2012 has emerged as the preferred week for the next F2F. 

###5.2 Host for the upcoming face to face meeting### 

Any volunteers?

Mark
> Progress Software has interest in hosting, but November is not a good match

Since no other volunteer for the upcoming f2f meeting shows up, Ram suggests to defer to next week, but to really try to close this issue next week.

###5.3 Venue of the upcoming face to face meeting###
    
Skipped due to missing host.

##6 Review typographic conventions for specifications [Sect6]##

>Context: [Typographic Conventions](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/46768/Typographical%20Conventions.docx) (a work in progress)

The editors are working on documenting a subset of the typographic conventions (styles for numbered lists, ordered list, code, etc.) currently defined in the official OASIS specification template. The editors plan to use those conventions and styles consistently across all the various OData specifications for a uniform look and feel. Letâ€™s review the conventions and provide feedback to the editors!

Discussion:

* Ram suggests that all members look it over and send comments to the editors.
* Martin explains, that a new revision is pending adding a missing OASIS style for tables etc.
