####4.2.1 [AI#0022](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/odata/members/action_item.php?action_item_id=3512)####

AI#0022
: "Investigate with the TC administration how to manage the isolated ABNF Grammar artifact in the standardizing process" [owner: Ram Jeyaraman] is **Closed** as __completed__ with no objections. 

Mike (Michael): 
>I **move** we break the XSD section of the CSDL specification into a separate, text-formatted XML document. **Martin seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Mike asks, which concrete name should be used.

** New Action**:
> Mike will take an action to come back with info on outcome of that discussion.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.


##5 Bunching up issues##

Context:
> Given the large number of issues, we could consider bunching up issues for approvals, if and where possible. For example, the bunch of issues that have previously been resolved by the TC and currently in the Applied state could potentially be approved via a single motion to Closed, assuming everyone has reviewed the application of the resolutions and are fine with it. If anyone has any concern over the application of the approved resolution for any of the issues in that bunch, we can peel off those issues and process them via separate motions. This optimization could free up some time which we could use for discussing issues. Letâ€™s discuss this and see if it makes sense to do it this way.

Discussion:

* Mike suggests that the grouping only be applied to issues that the TC has proposed and accepted resolutions for.
* Ralf agrees to discuss initially all issues separately
* Andrew suggests to not make a motion for gorupings in the future
* Colleen also suggests to not formalize, but keep the option of grouping open. In each case this may be considered, if the group prefers.

Otherwise there is consensus, that where possible issues may be grouped in motions.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. 

##6 Review of [Issues List](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&pid=10103&sorter/field=issuekey&sorter/order=ASC) (IL) and Progress##


###6.1 Applied resolutions from 2012-08-30###
 
Stefan: 
>I **move** that the ODATA-Issues with numbers 27, 50, 55, 59, 63 and 64 are approved 
as closed. **Andrew seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Mike explains, that in section 5.1, we should add Documentation to the list of zero or more child elements. We don't consistently list allowable children for other elements, but since we enumerate them here we should be comprehensive.

** New Action**:
> Mike will take an action to do this (as described in the discussion statement).

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.


####6.1.1 [ODATA-27](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-27)####

ODATA-50
: "Inheritance for ComplexType: BaseType and Abstract attributes missing" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as applied and closed** with no objections. 

####6.1.3 [ODATA-55](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-55)####

ODATA-55
: "Allow Documentation for Schema, EnumType, and Member" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as applied and closed** with no objections. 

####6.1.4 [ODATA-59](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-59)####

ODATA-59
: "Literal value 'Max' for MaxLength attribute is missing" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as applied and closed** with no objections. 

####6.1.5 [ODATA-63](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-63)####

ODATA-63
: "5.2.2 The edm:Alias Attribute should be optional" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as applied and closed** with no objections. 

####6.1.6 [ODATA-64](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-64)####

ODATA-64
: "Uniqueness of names of EntityContainer child elements" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as applied and closed** with no objections. 


###6.2 Trivial issues directly moved to Applied state###


####6.2.1 [ODATA-44](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-44)####

ODATA-44
: "Section 20: refer to rules in OData ABNF Construction Rules that define the necessary literals, add ABNF rules if necessary" [components: OData ABNF Construction Rules, OData CSDL] is **accepted as applied and closed** with no objections. 

Mike: 
>I **move** we accept the changes for ODATA-44 as applied. **Chris seconds**.

**No discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

####6.2.2 [ODATA-70](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-70)####

: "Correct definition of Edm.Time" [components: OData ATOM Format, OData CSDL] is **accepted as applied and closed** with no objections. 

Mike: 
>I **move** we accept the application of ODATA-70 in order to get the spec in a stable state and repurpose ODATA-107 to track the issue of Edm.Time and Edm.Duration. **Andrew seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Andrew asks, what the actual change in the document has been.
* Mike explains, that when Edm.Time was introduced it was intended to be xs:duration. ODATA-70 gets the documentation in a consistent state by consistently applying xs:duration for Edm.Time. 

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

###6.3 Issues in Open and Proposed state###

####6.3.1 [ODATA-48](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-48)####

Ralf: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-5 as proposed. **Mike seconds**.

**No discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.



####6.4.4 [ODATA-17](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-17)####

ODATA-17
: "Define which DataServiceVersion this specification defines: 3.0 or 4.0" [component: OData Protocol] is **accepted as proposed** with no objections. 

Ralf: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-17 as proposed. **Hubert seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Mike asks how to handle earlier versions. Describe them from retrospective or simply reserve/spare those?
* Andrew warns, that describing earlier OData versions is a lengthy and error-prone process. 
* Ram suggests to defer discussion, if consistent application is a point to think through before deciding
* Mike clarifies, that he is in favour to accept the proposed resolution, but wants to ensure, we as a group think it through/apply consistently
* Andrew suggests, that references to previous versions be non-normative
* Mark informs, that there are references to previous version in the JSON format document.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

** New Action**:
> Mike will take an action on completing the proposal with regard to consistency


####6.4.5 [ODATA-19](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-19)####

ODATA-19
: "New / alternative XML namespaces with OASIS naming convention" [component: OData CSDL] is **accepted as proposed** with no objections. 

Ralf: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-19 as proposed. **Stefan seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Mike agrees with oasis prefix in namespace, but asks if this will be an alternate namespace or "the only one"
* Ralf suggests only the oasis prefix starting with version 4
* Farrukh also thinks, that 4.0 should only use OASIS namespaces

Mike:
> I **move** to amend the motion that the OASIS specification define that, for DataServiceVersion 4.0 payloads, the OASIS prefix is used. Any reference to the previous OData namespace would be non-normative. **Stefan seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion will be amended**.

Ralf:
> I **move** that the new CSDL namespace is "http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/csdl/4.0". **Stefan seconds**.

**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion will be amended**.


**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **amended motion passes**.

Mike updated the proposal for JIRA ODATA-19 as follows: 
>The OASIS specifications will use namespaces following the OASIS conventions (http://docs.oasis-open.org/specGuidelines/ndr/namingDirectives.html#xml-namespaces). The new CSDL namespace will be: http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/csdl/4.0


####6.4.6 [ODATA-65](https://tools.oasis-open.org/issues/browse/ODATA-65)####

ODATA-65
: "Remove the edm:Mode attribute" [component: OData CSDL] is **opened and discussion deferred to next meeting** with no objections. 

Ralf: 
>I **move** to resolve ODATA-65 as proposed. **Stefan seconds**.

Discussion of motion:

* Mike explains, that currently when returning the edm:Mode attribute the only allowed value is "in". If we remove the attribute, we lose the possiblity to accomodate future uses where the value might be "in" or "out" as example. He thus suggests to defer to next meeting.

Chris: 
>I **move** to defer to next meeting. **Michael seconds**.


**No further discussion**. **No objections**. The **motion passes**.

End time scheduled for processing issues has now passed. All other processing deferred to next meeting.



##7 Extend TC meeting to 90 minutes?##

Context:
> Given the large number of issues and the need for more discussion time, should we consider extending the weekly TC meeting duration to 90 minutes?

Discussion:

* Dale: Yes.
* Ram asks if anyone has a problem, when we extend meeting time to 90 minutes?
* Chris is available for either starting earlier or ending later
* Mike could run later, or start 15 minutes earlier. Starting 30 minutes earlier is possible but difficult.

Stefan:
> I **move** to extend meeting time to 90 minutes by starting 15 minutes earlier.

Ram suggests move discussion to mailing list. 

**Agreed**

 
##8 Timeline and next steps##

###8.1 Have all known issues on core specification been filed?###

Discussion:

* Ram asks if there is anyone, who knows of an issue, that not has been filed yet?

**None**.


###8.2 Review of the Timeline [[TL_REF][TL_REF]] and discussion of immediate next steps.###

Ram suggests, that the chairs will prepare an updated timeline draft until next meeting.

**Agreed**.

##9 Next meeting##

###9.1 Proposed Thursday Sep 13, 2012 0800-0900 PT###

**Agreed**.


##10 AOB##

Discussion on next f2f meeting:

* Hubert asks, what the status of f2f planning is, since the agenda item is not present.
* Ram explains, that instead of discussing that same unchanged status again like in the last meetings, the chairs decided, they better try to first pull in a volunteer for hosting the Nov. 5th - 9th timeslot and then second come back to discuss further.

### Meeting adjourned on 0900 PT.###
